If you're going to have a long story arc then have a long story arc, don't just tape them together going \"I make epic now\".  The individual episodes of season 4 are good, but the individual parts of something do not make it as a integrated whole good.\r\n\r\nTl:dr; season 3 had budget cuts; season 4 tried too hard to convince people it was a deeper underlying story.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54f8aca06368725936e80e00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"when you see it\r\n!http://i.imgur.com/A86VGM0.jpg!","author":"9ba2e84e636164642cc03200"},{"id":"54f8ad266368726911842000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@EHAN\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54f8aca06368725936e80e00#post_54f8aca06368725936e80e00\r\nThat sucks","author":"51a2815b7f123be59500049b"},{"id":"54f8adbd6368725b75e30b00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54f7a07c63687233b85a0a00#post_54f7a07c63687233b85a0a00\r\n[bq=\"mariomarc\"]Some bald guy at work today randomly said to me \"Aw man, I thought I was gonna have the prettiest hair at work today, damnit!\"\r\n\r\nI had a good laugh[/bq]\r\nSame guy this morning said same thing about my hair\r\n\r\nAm I getting hit on?","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"54f8ae0f6368725ae8401500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54f8adbd6368725b75e30b00#post_54f8adbd6368725b75e30b00\r\nEither you're getting hit on or you're being indoctrinated into the Society of the Blind Eye\r\n\r\nHave you ever seen anything weird?","author":"9ba2e84e636164642cc03200"},{"id":"54f8b0046368725e3c140e00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@EHAN\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54f8aca06368725936e80e00#post_54f8aca06368725936e80e00\r\nI don't see it\r\n","author":"515ddf93a4c72d8a1f000d57"},{"id":"54f8b0406368725e3c420e00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@ParagonCommander\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54f8b0046368725e3c140e00#post_54f8b0046368725e3c140e00\r\n[spoiler]There are Cars sandwich between another 2 row of cars making getting out IMPOSSIBLE[/spoiler]","author":"50c204917f123b31440000a5"},{"id":"54f8b0a96368727452dd0400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Number1pegasus\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54f8b0406368725e3c420e00#post_54f8b0406368725e3c420e00\r\nOoooh.\r\nUsually when someone says \"when you see it\" I expect something out of the ordinary or weird.

Fast forward to last wednesday, where our dog went in to have surgery to have the lump removed, when he was ready to return home, we were told that the vets would have to check if the lump they removed was cancerous, and if it would cause further health issues.\r\n\r\nToday we got a phone call from our vet saying they got the tests back and the lump that was removed was a benign tumour, which could have developed into a very agressive form of cancer due to where it was, and if it didn't it could have potetially grown and started blocking an important blood vessal, so if I hadn't found the lump when I did, our dog would have some very major health problems in the future.","author":"4fde01d7945b70057c00024d"},{"id":"54f8b3686368726147ba1000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I'm just sitting here waiting for more informations to be added to the FNAF wiki about FNAF 3.","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"54f8b3d9636872575ee91200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@HeroInferno\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54f8b35463687256a8a01500#post_54f8b35463687256a8a01500\r\nWell, I'm glad he's ok.
