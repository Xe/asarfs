The series' conclusion is that while anybody can be redeemed, it is titular character Johan Liebert's refusal to seek redemption that makes him a monster. A sadistic chessmaster and manipulative bastard since he learned to walk and talk, Johan is on a personal journey to become, in his own words, as dark as possible, all while trying to find out if there is anyone as evil as he is out there, or failing that, force the heroic Dr. Tenma, and/or his own pacifistic sister, Nina Foertner, to kill him in cold blood. In this way, he hopes to establish that even the best people can become just like him. Along the way he convinces children to jump from rooftops, gets a recovering alcoholic drunk before throwing him off a building, and convinces various serial killers to murder every foster family he has ever lived with, as part of his quest to become an unperson. Numerous Freudian Excuses are proposed for Johan's behavior, yet each one is ultimately undermined, revealing that in the end, Johan simply is pure, unadulterated evil.!*","author":"509f70a87f123b77eb0004fd"},{"id":"54e34b2f63687267befe2000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Thanotos Omega\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54e34aaa63687214cbbe0300#post_54e34aaa63687214cbbe0300\r\nSo wait, he just wants to be evil?\r\n\r\n~^What a waste of his life.^~","author":"4fe1b9f47f123b13df002976"},{"id":"54e34b7e6368723049d25200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@HJSDGCE\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54e34b2f63687267befe2000#post_54e34b2f63687267befe2000\r\nSounds like a perfect idea.","author":"505696b47f123b37e800effa"},{"id":"54e34b8263687221e66f0700","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@HJSDGCE\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54e34b2f63687267befe2000#post_54e34b2f63687267befe2000\r\nYep,\r\n\r\n!http://fc00.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2015/044/0/3/rengar_by_alirusa-d8hv6jr.png!","author":"509f70a87f123b77eb0004fd"},{"id":"54e3563f63687255d8290400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Well, goodnight y'all.\r\n\r\nNo quirky comments tonight.","author":"4fe1b9f47f123b13df002976"},{"id":"54e35d726368726db3570200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Albus Fahrenheits\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54e32e536368723c654f1100#post_54e32e536368723c654f1100\r\n[bq=\"Albus Fahrenheits\"]I need faster internet.[/bq]\r\nMove to Google Fiber land","author":"9ba2e84e636164642cc03200"},{"id":"54e35e2063687260e8710b00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Every time I hear someone be described as 'raving lunatic' I can't help but imagine said person in a club or some sort partying all night with strobe lights and glow sticks.\r\n\r\n","author":"52f0834d63687261cba90300"},{"id":"54e368f76368722f4d171800","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Albus Fahrenheits\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54e35e2063687260e8710b00#post_54e35e2063687260e8710b00\r\n!http://i.imgur.com/Q8ufz.gif!\r\n!http://i.imgur.com/ONZJafE.gif!\r\n!http://i.imgur.com/5WQS3Mm.gif!","author":"9ba2e84e636164642cc03200"},{"id":"54e36b726368724425892100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Albus Fahrenheits\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54e35e2063687260e8710b00#post_54e35e2063687260e8710b00\r\nProtip for raves, Bring your own water.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54e36d3c6368720bcfbe0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@EHAN\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54e368f76368722f4d171800#post_54e368f76368722f4d171800\r\nThat is what I mean.\r\n\r\nAlso,\r\n\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54e36b726368724425892100#post_54e36b726368724425892100\r\nWhy?","author":"52f0834d63687261cba90300"},{"id":"54e36d7c6368720bcfdf0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Albus Fahrenheits\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54e36d3c6368720bcfbe0200#post_54e36d3c6368720bcfbe0200\r\nThere have been many cases of people spiking bottles of water with ecstasy.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54e36e5c63687207ae330300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54e36d7c6368720bcfdf0200#post_54e36d7c6368720bcfdf0200\r\nOh, right then.\r\nI don't even go to raves.","author":"52f0834d63687261cba90300"},{"id":"54e36edf636872232fe20a00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Albus Fahrenheits\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54e36e5c63687207ae330300#post_54e36e5c63687207ae330300\r\nIf you ever get the chance you should go to one.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54e3716b63687207aec90300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Albus Fahrenheits\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54e338f063687267be6e1800#post_54e338f063687267be6e1800\r\nThat's the fucking problem; the area is economically dead.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"}]}
