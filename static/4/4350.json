That's strategy to humiliate students as either way you choose, everyone sees you and you become the target of the audience. I had to stand in front of everyone while the teacher does speeches and stuff which is pretty long. Once the assembly is done, we have to pick up trash around the area. Sometimes, the teacher would go to us and even ask us why we're late and mock us about it with the microphone.\r\n\r\nThat was elementary school. Which is why I wondered why my high school days aren't as tough as I thought.","author":"4fe1b9f47f123b13df002976"},{"id":"54f2604e63687268a7860100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Oof2oDOeRZg/VPIBQv0oAMI/AAAAAAACKoM/7aEUu5OSiIQ/s1600/RDPlushie.jpg!","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"54f2606b6368727f31cf0600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SeraphimDawn\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54f2604e63687268a7860100#post_54f2604e63687268a7860100\r\n\"Kill me.\"","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54f260a863687254cc540100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SeraphimDawn\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54f2604e63687268a7860100#post_54f2604e63687268a7860100\r\nActually, it kinda looks cute.","author":"4fe1b9f47f123b13df002976"},{"id":"54f260d96368725c98140d00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\r\n[bq=\"SquiggyBomb\"]\"@SeraphimDawn\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54f2604e63687268a7860100#post_54f2604e63687268a7860100\r\n\"Kill me.\"[/bq]\r\n","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"54f261316368721fddce0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@HJSDGCE\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54f260a863687254cc540100#post_54f260a863687254cc540100\r\n\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54f2606b6368727f31cf0600#post_54f2606b6368727f31cf0600\r\n\"@Carcass Strife\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54f260d96368725c98140d00#post_54f260d96368725c98140d00\r\nRD with her Doge impression.\r\n!http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/doge.jpg!\r\n\r\nTwilight is just... weird.","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"54f2614d636872671f770800","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SeraphimDawn\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54f261316368721fddce0000#post_54f261316368721fddce0000\r\n!http://m.quickmeme.com/img/ea/ea724f8a70b0ebaa70c5f51fc95a46eb5eeb2b6f5c0a4a4c14d0bf5067819bc3.jpg!","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"54f261806368725e06bb0300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Carcass Strife\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54f2614d636872671f770800#post_54f2614d636872671f770800\r\nRare candies.\r\nNot even once.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54f261a3636872606ede0400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54f261806368725e06bb0300#post_54f261806368725e06bb0300\r\n...\r\n_This_","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"54f261b26368725e85970400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@EHAN\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54f254d56368726ed36e0100#post_54f254d56368726ed36e0100\r\n[bq=\"EHAN\"]\"@Princess♠Molestia\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54f254a46368725e069a0200#post_54f254a46368725e069a0200\r\nBut I don't have TF2\r\n\r\nD:[/bq]\r\nYou don't have a free game?\r\n\r\nwat","author":"5012e49c7f123b4012000341"},{"id":"54f2622f636872646ee60800","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@ArcticEight\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54f261b26368725e85970400#post_54f261b26368725e85970400\r\nI don't have Steam\r\n\r\nI haven't gotten Steam because I wanna get a new laptop first","author":"9ba2e84e636164642cc03200"},{"id":"54f262906368724dc4590300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"Ey, children!
