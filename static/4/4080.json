A group of friends on a big dumb adventure. One Piece is successful because of how much unbridled fun it is to read. And it does this by never once pandering to a specific audience. Naruto fell flat because Kishimoto started to worship Sasuke. Bleach failed because Kubo kept adding characters without developing the ones he had. That made these series less fun to read.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54e2c52c6368725506d00500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54e2c4a36368722a1b170e00#post_54e2c4a36368722a1b170e00\r\nIt also helps that Oda has a mindset of \"keep improving\"","author":"500757fd7f123b75a90003b1"},{"id":"54e2c55f6368725716c60800","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54e2c4a36368722a1b170e00#post_54e2c4a36368722a1b170e00\r\n\r\n-is that REDLINE ON YOUR AVATAR-","author":"511c09ec7f123b35980001eb"},{"id":"54e2c57a63687247648e0f00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Miyo\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54e2c55f6368725716c60800#post_54e2c55f6368725716c60800\r\nYOOOOOOO!\r\nREDLINE IS THE SICKEST!","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54e2c58e63687274ca700000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54e2c4a36368722a1b170e00#post_54e2c4a36368722a1b170e00\r\nehem\r\nKubo has his own character to worship\r\n[spoiler]!http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20140321023221/bleach/en/images/a/ab/Aizen.png![/spoiler]\r\nIT WAS EXACTLY AS PLANNED.","author":"505696b47f123b37e800effa"},{"id":"54e2c5c06368724764a30f00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@igotnopicks\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54e2c58e63687274ca700000#post_54e2c58e63687274ca700000\r\nFucking Aizen man...\r\nHe started out so cool and then just got laaaaaaaaame!","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54e2c6566368722e91540a00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"So I'm getting fired from work because I know too much about things. . .
