We could just one day and get lucky and find something, but it's just resource impossible currently to do so.\r\n\r\nIt's why I'm so excited for how technology if your ability to monitor frequencies is exponentially increasing then that exponentially increases your ability to find aliens.\r\n\r\nWill we ever be able to talk to them?
