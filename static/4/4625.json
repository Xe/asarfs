She was transported when enjoying the countryside instead of the city life where she would beat up gang members and force them to pay with money or blood. She made allies with the Tin Man; a man forced to wear an indestructible suit of armor, Lion; a _lion_ that had been thrown out of the circus and Scarecrow; who is pretty much a hobo. She is widely known as \"Red Shoes\" Dorothy.\r\n\r\nSnow White, an young girl with important relations that is forced to flee from her power-hungry step mother. She later lived in a rundown apartment near the woods at the edge of town. She is also guarded by the \"Seven Dwarves\", a group of bodyguards in suits that are only called \"dwarves\" because they dwarf those around them. They protect her and sometimes steal money if given the chance.\r\n\r\nMary Poppins, a witch that travels to a dysfunctional family as a sign of gratitude to a similar witch that helped her and gave her magic. She acts as a nanny and make the children's lives terrible in order to teach them how to mature and protect themselves from dangerous investors and slavers. Their father, George, was a knight at the Banks Order, ruled by the Grandmaster Dawes. He was thrown out after making a mistake that jeopardized the Order. Using the magic words taught to him by Mary Poppins; ‚ÄúSupercalifragilisticexpialidocious‚Äù, Grandmaster Dawes died the other day due to uncontrollable laughter. His son discovered that his father was cursed and rehired George as he needed as many knights as he can due to the loss of morale.","author":"4fe1b9f47f123b13df002976"},{"id":"550306c163687268afec0600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"[spoiler]Now it‚Äôs true that Ruby is sadly lacking in booby\r\nbut she‚Äôs certainly no newbie\r\nJust give her some lubey\r\nand she‚Äôll make you howl like Scooby.\r\n\r\nIt‚Äôs certainly nice to get freaky with Weiss\r\nbut you‚Äôd better think twice\r\nHer skin‚Äôs as cold as ice\r\nand she squeals like mice.\r\n\r\nShe‚Äôs a bit of a flake\r\nbut it‚Äôs fun to screw Blake\r\nShe gets as wet as a lake\r\nyou‚Äôll never have to fake\r\nand she‚Äôs got a lot of love to make\r\n\r\n\"I need a gang to bang!\" Said Yang\r\nexposing her thang\r\nto make the boys go \"Dang!\"[/spoiler]","author":"4fde426c945b700a970029ac"},{"id":"5503077d636872653b800800","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@AppleJackFrost\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5502fb1c6368726335b01000#post_5502fb1c6368726335b01000\r\n[bq=\"AppleJackFrost\"]Nothin' like watchin' the 2nd part of the Persona 3 movie.\r\n[spoiler]!https://40.media.tumblr.com/7f19f5fdee93c5bd9ac3d7c81d2a3a51/tumblr_nl2yanlhEd1t2xcwyo2_540.png![/spoiler][/bq]\r\nToo bad Ken had fuck everything over.\r\nMan FUCK KEN.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"550307bf63687268af350700","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!https://images.encyclopediadramatica.se/c/cd/4chan-fit-bread.png!","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"550309b8636872506c0f0400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I finally got around to practising legs.
