Giving clean clothes and soap to a woman that has been raped is a godsend.\r\n\r\nYou want to know how you can support glbt, minorities, veterans and women all in one go?  Donate to your local shelter.  It doesn't cost a lot of money dude; donating old clothes you don't wear or blankets is extremely cheap.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere will always be inequality in the world, *BUT* giving a fresh pair of clothes, soap, letting them have a bath to a person that has been raped instead of them being forced to walk around with the person's stench all over them is a godsend.  If say they were raped in their own bedroom on their bed I don't think they would want to use those blankets either.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5516f1036368720f6e040200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@hype\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5516f06663687273e9920400#post_5516f06663687273e9920400\r\nI go for walks all the time right across the street from a school, and i am a creep looking introverted 27 year old, who often wears a torn mold stained shirt,","author":"509f70a87f123b77eb0004fd"},{"id":"5516f15063687275322d0500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Hello guys.","author":"5012e49c7f123b4012000341"},{"id":"5516f1576368720f6e220200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"JESUS these guys suck at Custom Robo!","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"5516f18963687277329b0600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@ArcticEight\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5516f15063687275322d0500#post_5516f15063687275322d0500\r\nHallo.","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"5516f1aa63687217d3f10000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Thanotos Omega\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5516f1036368720f6e040200#post_5516f1036368720f6e040200\r\ni'm no stranger to wearing less than presentable clothing either, but i see plenty of hispanics doing the same thing smoking their cigarillos while unmolested by the police","author":"50a843d47f123b2e7c001359"},{"id":"5516f1ad63687278a4580500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Thanotos Omega\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5516f1036368720f6e040200#post_5516f1036368720f6e040200\r\nSo you feel guilty for being a straight white male?","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5516f1f06368727428040700","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5516f0566368727791a10700#post_5516f0566368727791a10700\r\n[bq=\"SquiggyBomb\"]\"Squiggy find thing\":https://www.change.org/p/operation-robo-rebirth-petition-for-a-new-custom-robo[/bq]\r\n*YOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!*\r\n\r\nAlso, Guys.
