I simply mean that Might For Right is a spiritual ideal.\r\n\r\nIn fact, I'm of the opinion that relative to nearly every powerful religion Christianity is pretty much one of the better ones.\r\n\r\nEven its great \"crimes\" of the past are mostly based on mythical ahistorical retellings in our media (meaning movies and shows) and certainly no worse than the times in general were.\r\nBut really that has more to do with the fact that our popular conception of the Dark Ages in Europe is pretty incorrect based on the best evidence we have.\r\nListverse has a great little thing on the Middle Ages (top 10 myths or something) that SeraphimDawn linked a while ago.[/bq]\r\n\r\nI wouldn't call Christianity the better faith over anything. There were about twenty crusades of significant importance called throughout the middle ages and into the high/late Middle Ages by the Catholic See against numerous groups across Europe and Africa; Muslims, Pagans, other Christians that didn't agree. Like wise, their \"treatment of alternate ideologies\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catharism#Suppression wasn't as grand, as compared to Islam where at least a number of schools within the two major branches came and went as they pleased. During the crusades even, a vast majority of the native Jewish population was massacred in Jerusalem, along with some Christian minorities that lived there.\r\n\r\n\"And fundamentalist activity hasn't stopped today.\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_terrorism","author":"4fe4bf947f123b175b000001"},{"id":"53988d20636872306eef0400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"treehome95\":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L0rgIYnkjU&feature=kp \r\n","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"53989959636872143b7e0500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@AaronMk\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/539887366368723338990200#post_539887366368723338990200\r\nI assume you refer to the reign of Saladin?","author":"4fe16df67f123b13e400003f"},{"id":"53989afa6368720647450200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Whatevs\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53989959636872143b7e0500#post_53989959636872143b7e0500\r\n\r\nNot even during his existence.","author":"4fe4bf947f123b175b000001"},{"id":"53989d146368722b22530200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!https://24.media.tumblr.com/cc612a545de61968d2ca4b317bea49dd/tumblr_msl039EZp31rbb611o1_400.png!\r\n\r\n\"six word horror story\"","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"53989db76368722b229f0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@AaronMk\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53989afa6368720647450200#post_53989afa6368720647450200\r\nWell what period do you mean?\r\n\r\nBecause I'm aware the idea of Saladin being open to other religions is probably untrue.
