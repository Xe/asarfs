Thats perfectly ok. \r\n\r\nWhat matters is you read it and you are saying this based on your opinion and not on just assumption from what you heard from other people. \r\n\r\nSeriously that's all I honestly wanted you to do. Especially since you convinced trash to probably buy ZOE 2 which he was saying he didn't want to play for the exact reasons of overhyped. But you told him to anyway.\r\n\r\nAND HE WAS GOING TO BUY IT WITH HIS OWN MONEY. \r\n\r\nNow you don't look like a hypocrite (Of course I say that with no disrespect) for not giving it a chance first. because now you hate it based on what _you_ read and based on what _you_ saw. And I feel that's fair For the people you have recommended stuff too. \r\n\r\nNow go into your little Coma knowing you actually read it. And I'm glad to have wasted your time! \r\n!http://setfreefromtheic.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/black-woman-attitude.jpg!\r\nAnd I'll see yo ass next week. \r\n\r\nAlso before you ask no I'm not mad. I'm _happy_ that you at least gave it a try. :)\r\n\r\nSo thank you for at least reading it.\r\n\r\nAnd I agree its not for everyone but you at least tried it. And that's all that matters. \r\n\r\nAnd now to be fair what do you recommend for me? Go ahead!
