Because I thought you were saying harnessing the energy of a Black Hole and _than_ using it as a weapon. \r\n\r\nAlso I'm not talking about someone using a Black Hole to blow it up. I'm talking about Regular beams and other weapons. Of course you cant do anything against a Black hole.\r\n\r\nAlso I know using a Black Hole as an Energy source is Dangerous. Its a black hole, Its always Dangerous! \r\n\r\n~(Which I also don't condone anyone using a Black hole as a weapon too, since now you can blow us all up with it, well Suck in/Implode)~ ","author":"50c204917f123b31440000a5"},{"id":"5514568163687214a0521a00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@EHAN\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5514557d63687214de261000#post_5514557d63687214de261000\r\nWhere's the flying cow?","author":"505696b47f123b37e800effa"},{"id":"5514576f6368721a8a770400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@EHAN\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5514557d63687214de261000#post_5514557d63687214de261000\r\nNice murderweather ya got there","author":"5007bbdf7f123b112f00023a"},{"id":"55145893636872098ec32400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@PaskaNaakka\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5514576f6368721a8a770400#post_5514576f6368721a8a770400\r\nMeanwhile in California\r\n!http://www.nationalturk.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/California-Mega-Earthquake-Warning-12.jpg!","author":"505696b47f123b37e800effa"},{"id":"5514596a63687217e5d50a00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"Well that's a loaded question\"\r\n!http://thumbs.dreamstime.com/t/isolated-gun-question-mark-cartoon-firing-flag-50157702.jpg!\r\n-i apologize-","author":"9ba2e84e636164642cc03200"},{"id":"55145a0e63687215583c1100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Acstlu is still at it.","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"55145a55636872098e252700","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I think I've lost about 3 nights of sleep thanks to Steven Universe.

For example; well over several hundred years the news was the authority figure and in turn decided what was mainstream culture.\r\n\r\nNot to drag drama into this thread, but look at third wave feminism; they followed the playbook exactly on how to gain control over culture word for word, but why did they lose in the usa?  They came too late.  What came about in the 1990's?  That's easy.\r\n\r\nFor ten thousand years the people in charge were the ones that made the \"facts\" that were accepted by the general populace, but now no matter how much you're in power you'll get instantly called out on your bullshit if you're a public figure.\r\n\r\nWhy is this important?  To put it simply it blows the fuck up out of how societies currently work.  To use an analogy let's say the vote for the Iraq war started in say 2005 instead of 2003, the war would have never happened; what was the big difference in such a short amount of time?  In 2003 it was accepted \"fact\" that Saddam had nukes.  On the other hand if say they started a vote in 2003 to invade Iran we would instead be in Iran instead of Iraq.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"55146777636872207a140100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/551466526368721f52c00400#post_551466526368721f52c00400\r\n!http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/85/852df6703603ebe0016646fa129c645eda2f877d2f793c2e32f09a80cbd7fd40.jpg!","author":"31bee2686368722a0df23600"},{"id":"551467946368721b73161100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Gizoid101\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55146777636872207a140100#post_55146777636872207a140100\r\nEveryone did.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"551467c26368721199530000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/551466526368721f52c00400#post_551466526368721f52c00400\r\nFALLOUT 3.","author":"505696b47f123b37e800effa"},{"id":"551468406368721b8e0f0e00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"The stasi were likely the best secret police ever.\r\nKGB trained Germans are scurry.
