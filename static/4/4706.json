Before the gloves, a person will do MORE damage with boxing gloves for a few reasons. A person is much less likely to hold back for fear of hurting themselves (personal experience), or the other person, thinking the gloves will protect them. The padding of the glove distributes the force of impact across more area. Boxing gloves exist primarily to prevent the fists from getting damaged (human bones are strong, hand bones are weak, and the face sports many inconvenient angles to break your hand on). It does reduce the chance of blood from facial cuts, but it increases the risk of brain damage. One of the reasons they eschew traditional boxing gloves in UFC is that it's safer (well, that and they'd make grappling a bitch). \r\n\r\nNow whether you consider progressive brain damage a plus or not it's up to personal choice","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"55066b3d6368727d33270a00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55066abf6368721a5e5f0400#post_55066abf6368721a5e5f0400\r\nYou go take up boxing\r\nI'll take up an eastern martial art\r\n\r\n\r\nThen we'll see who's the best!","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"55066b576368725ca4070800","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Well that's the end of that I suppose.\r\n\r\n","author":"50c204917f123b31440000a5"},{"id":"55066b6c63687274d49b0400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55066abf6368721a5e5f0400#post_55066abf6368721a5e5f0400\r\nI've done some boxing before.
