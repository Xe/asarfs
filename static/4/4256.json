Handing regulatory oversight to the government to solve a problem that was caused by the government, when perfectly good technology is coming out to address the issue (google fiber), is killing the golden goose.\r\n\r\nIt simply establishes precedent for the government to extert more influence. As it does whenever it gets authority over something. \r\n\r\nAnd like I said, the issue with our carriers was caused by the government in the 30s when they granted monopoly powers to wire up the country. \r\nMoreover, the issue it is looking to solve... Has not happened. The story of Netflix is actually a completely unrelated issue.\r\nYou're not saving anything because there is no fire.\r\n\r\nThe issues of federal control probably wont come to pass for a while because incremental creep is how these thibgs usually happen ","author":"4fe16df67f123b13e400003f"},{"id":"54ede5e36368723cf68d2500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"im gonna become a mod on KYM","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"54ede9256368727899650e00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Twisty\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54ede5e36368723cf68d2500#post_54ede5e36368723cf68d2500\r\nCongrats.","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"54eded25636872348adf3c00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@HJSDGCE\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54ed5c02636872268fee0f00#post_54ed5c02636872268fee0f00\r\n[bq=\"HJSDGCE\"]Man, why am I always ignored?\r\n\r\n*sulks at corner*[/bq]\r\n\r\n!http://gifsec.com/wp-content/uploads/GIF/2014/04/Vladimir-Putin-laugh-gif.gif!\r\n\r\nYou pathetic scum don't know how is being ignored here all the time.","author":"5239db6da4c72d22d9000358"},{"id":"54edf0a063687230b7c25000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Shadow the Hedgehog\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54eded25636872348adf3c00#post_54eded25636872348adf3c00\r\n\r\nThis just gives me an incentive to ignore you further.","author":"37e5b9d66361642500af5e00"},{"id":"54edf1116368723de7d62200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Kaz\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54edf0a063687230b7c25000#post_54edf0a063687230b7c25000\r\nIGNORING DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT.","author":"505696b47f123b37e800effa"},{"id":"54edf15463687273d45e2700","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@igotnopicks\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54edf1116368723de7d62200#post_54edf1116368723de7d62200\r\n\r\n\r\nI am a very sadistic person","author":"37e5b9d66361642500af5e00"},{"id":"54edf3286368720b4e142500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Whatevs\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54eda8b86368720f05034900#post_54eda8b86368720f05034900\r\nDude; not all governmental oversight is inherently bad.  While we all shit on the FCC it weren't for them companies could block access to the internet and force you to use internet provider services by their own company in hotels or such, they could still block torrents and such.\r\n\r\nWhile I do agree that over-regulation is a problem having no regulation is also a problem.  No regulation is like a car without a brake, over-regulation is like a car without a gas peddal; the amount of regulation needed is like the speed limit in either you let up on regulation and speed up or you press on the brake so you don't go careening into the a oncoming vehicle at 120mp/h.\r\n\r\nHow much regulation is required?  Depends on the industry, the company and the times.  To use an analogy police are a form of regulation; without them society would be fucked and on the other hand a police state is bad also; you don't want anarchy and you don't want 1984.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54edf5cb6368723a97640800","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Kaz\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54edf0a063687230b7c25000#post_54edf0a063687230b7c25000\r\n...Sorry who are you?","author":"5239db6da4c72d22d9000358"},{"id":"54edf66a6368721adb0e1700","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"On the Subject of this Net Neutrality thing I found this just this morning on the news thing on bing\":http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-fcc-net-neutrality-20150225-story.html#page=1\r\n\r\n\"FCC's net neutrality plan spurs debate on how to keep open Internet\"","author":"50c204917f123b31440000a5"},{"id":"54edf8ed6368723e7b5b2e00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Shadow the Hedgehog\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54edf5cb6368723a97640800#post_54edf5cb6368723a97640800\r\n\r\nI am \"you\"","author":"37e5b9d66361642500af5e00"},{"id":"54edf96f6368723b8fe70900","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Kaz\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54edf8ed6368723e7b5b2e00#post_54edf8ed6368723e7b5b2e00\r\nWell go find that 4th DAMN Chaos Emerald.","author":"505696b47f123b37e800effa"}]}
