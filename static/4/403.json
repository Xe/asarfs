If the human race ever does go extinct that is probably what is going to kill everyone.  The people that will actually live will people that embrace technological advancement.\r\n\r\nTo use a analogy of what I mean is that if you don't like technology you're either going to die of disease/no water/starving to death or so forth.\r\n\r\nTo use a analogy nanomachines and nanoparticles are currently being looked at to cure all disease.  Nanoparticles have the potential of ending viruses once and for all due to a experimental nanoparticle structure that essentially acts like a rat-trap for viruses.  It doesn't boost your immune system or anything; rather it traps viruses and destroys them.  Nanomachines, inb4 revengeance quote, in a couple decades will probably cause people to become biologically immortal.\r\n\r\nDon't like nanomachines or nanoparticles?  Well you're going to die.  Once nanoparticles reach the consumer market traditional vaccines will not be able to compete and thus get the axe; meaning any new viruses you'll have to either get a nanoparticle injection or die.  Nanomachines will pretty much make traditional medicine obsolete and thus traditional medicine would die; so let's say you get cancer, you're only two options would to get nanomachine injections or die.\r\n\r\nAnother example is how they're working on robotic surgeons; in fifteen years time you'll either have to get surgery from a robot or die cause traditional by human hands surgery will not be taught anymore.  So if let's say your arm gets chopped off and you refuse surgery from a robot demanding surgery from a human; no one in the hospital will know how to perform hands on surgery anymore so you're going to die.\r\n\r\nMy money is on something like MERS or such after traditional non-nanomachine and non-nanoparticle medicine industry dying becoming extremely contagious and killing off insane amounts of people.  Basically a modern day equivalent of the black death, except the reason why people will be dying in such large numbers won't be because we won't be able to combat it, but rather people will refuse to seek medical treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\nTl:dr; If you refuse medical treatment with a life threatening illness chances are you're going to die.\r\n\"@SeraphimDawn\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/538b75a76368725762b70400#post_538b75a76368725762b70400\r\n[bq=\"SeraphimDawn\"]\"@Randomosaur\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/538b71b26368725815590300#post_538b71b26368725815590300\r\n...
