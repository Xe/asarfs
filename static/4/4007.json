Getting past all the \"femnazis are feminizing men\" bullshit you hear about they do kind of have a point; if you look at fashion and how people in photos look there has been a considerable change.  A hundred years ago, which is a short fucking time history wise, women had to wear dresses and god forbid they show any ankle; men had to wear pants and shit.\r\n\r\nI'm obviously not agreeing with the nutters, but rather the norm seems to be shifting in the opposite direction in the west.  Obviously a lot of men like being ultra masculine and a lot of women like being ultra feminine, but rather my point is that in say fifty years I would not be surprised if it was the norm for men to wear shirts, dresses, wear makeup and for women to wear. . . well shit man I don't even know cause I've met some pretty masculine women before.\r\n\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54decde363687279f23c0000#post_54decde363687279f23c0000\r\n[bq=\"SquiggyBomb\"]\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54decd2263687233dbe50500#post_54decd2263687233dbe50500\r\nHow long till Tumblr gets super butthurt about \"Men invading female territory\"[/bq]\r\nIt's already happened.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54decfbf63687268882c0700","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Thanotos Omega\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54decf316368721d3fb71000#post_54decf316368721d3fb71000\r\n[bq=\"Thanotos Omega\"]\"@EHAN\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54decd0e6368727e792f0f00#post_54decd0e6368727e792f0f00\r\nSome day we will reach the point where a female hero can go strait up topless and it be treated as just her showing off her muscles like when a guy does it, While a male hero in another pulls a james bond like move but instead of messing with his tie he touches up his makeup. and on that day we will be a better collection of people, slowly casting off the outdated gender barriers, that have for to long told half the population you must be this and the other half you must be that, [/bq]\r\nand the world will be all the better for having come so far","author":"9ba2e84e636164642cc03200"},{"id":"54decfe56368721d3fe21000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54decf1b6368724e89672500#post_54decf1b6368724e89672500\r\nWhile i personally say where your interests with pride, As a shy mother fucker who doesn't like even talking to the people at mcdonolds to order his food, i say just do it around halloween with some halloweeny stuff in a bag allot of folks may think your getting stuff for a costume, or at the very least you can think that,","author":"509f70a87f123b77eb0004fd"},{"id":"54ded05c63687216d3aa0300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54decf336368724e89712500#post_54decf336368724e89712500\r\n\"Miss, You were going way over the speed limit.
