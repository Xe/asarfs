To use an analogy think about how the illuminati in Deus Ex: Human Revolution spent all that time, money and resources to control the internet.  The internet is currently causing hundreds of years of societal drift in only a few short years.  Groups like the NSA, RIAA, SJW, Republicans, Democrats, a lot of countries and such are afraid but they can no longer try to stop the internet cause in order for countries to succeed economically now they literally need the internet so they want to control the internet.\r\n\r\nThat's why you see anti-geek movements cause geeks make the internet work.\r\nThat's why you see SOPA and such to try to control the internet.\r\nThat's why you see SJW and such cause they want to control the societal drift by controlling the people who make the internet work.\r\n\r\nThese groups are both afraid of the rapid societal drift but they also need the internet to physically continue to exist as a group.\r\n\r\nSpecial interest groups are fucking insane to think they can control something that is fundamentally unpredictable.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54eebcf2636872799fdb0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54eebc4863687235a5de0400#post_54eebc4863687235a5de0400\r\nWelp!
