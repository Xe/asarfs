Wow I don't even. . . I'm starting to lose what sliver of respect I still had for 24/7 news.\r\n\r\nIf you're wondering what I mean by this is that the EU recently ruled that if a individual or such wants to be delinked from search sites and/or removal of their information from such that say google must abide or face criminal charges.  Basically to combat the NSA spying.\r\n\r\nYou know how american news responded?  By calling it socialism. . . Wait; so by that logic they're stating having individual rights and right to privacy is socialism and saying that it's infringing on the rights of the individual so by that logic if we don't want to live in a socialist nation then we should live in a police state with no individual freedoms.\r\n\r\nThat brings the total list of fucked up things the american news has done in the past six months to:\r\nDefending rapist\r\nDefending murderers\r\nDefending racists\r\nDefending sexist\r\nDefending homophobes\r\nDefending tyranny\r\nDefending inequality\r\nDefending corruption\r\n\r\n24/7 news where freedom is tyranny; where something against racism is racism; where promotion of equality is inequality and so forth.\r\n\r\nAnd they still wonder why their viewership is going down?","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"538cbada63687212236a0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/538cab9e6368726102080200#post_538cab9e6368726102080200\r\nI believe in privacy as a basic human right. What the NSA is doing blatantly infringes on that right.  But I'm also absolute on anti-censorship... I just hope the _right to privacy_ isn't going to be abused in a way that leads to censorship. Are you sure you want corporations, governments, and radical groups to use the same rights to blindfold the public? Trying to determine what should or should not be forgotten is the difficult part under often rigid laws.","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"538ccce46368727e741f0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!https://24.media.tumblr.com/cd0f77b435b6ba8424229e4171733818/tumblr_n6ivnnHWGF1tv8ak4o1_500.png!
