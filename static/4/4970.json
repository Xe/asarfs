Spring Trap is represented by the Purple Guy. And if you get the good ending...\r\n\r\nGolden Freddy is represented by the crying kid.\r\n\r\nWhat bothered me is that the children killed became murderous animatronics but Golden Freddy... well, he's not really murderous. In fact, we don't even know what he is. All we know is that if he catches you, the game ends. Not \"game over\", not \"you lose\", the game just ends.\r\n\r\nAlso, Golden Freddy doesn't move at all. He is always in a limp position, like there's nothing to move him.\r\n\r\nThis is why my theory was that the crying kid was the only survivor. The fact that Golden Freddy is all limp is because there's nothing in him. There is no soul that resides in his body. The crying kid represents Golden Freddy and yet, the animatronic's not even alive. Not like the others.\r\n\r\nThe animatronic is empty.","author":"4fe1b9f47f123b13df002976"},{"id":"551550526368726aff460500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Nearly done with this Kill la Kill show.","author":"4fdef063945b700a9d01604f"},{"id":"5515528b6368726badf50000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@AppleJackFrost\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/551550526368726aff460500#post_551550526368726aff460500\r\n@DO YOU APPRECIATE RYUKO CHAN?@","author":"31bee2686368722a0df23600"},{"id":"551553b96368726b44200500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@HJSDGCE\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/551547c16368720e5ab20200#post_551547c16368720e5ab20200\r\nWell, if the Crying Child was the only survivor...\r\nHow did he scare the Purple Guy into Springtrap?","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"5515549d6368726c55330000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Carcass Strife\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/551553b96368726b44200500#post_551553b96368726b44200500\r\nI like to think of an unseen force that the Purple Guy can see but everyone else (including us) can't.\r\nMaybe the image of Golden Freddy scared him.
