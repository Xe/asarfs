The problem with the movie and film industry is slightly different in that sales and viewership is steadily going down(sorry tv industry, but the internet is really killing the tv star); the problem with the video game industry is that now if you want a photo-realistic game you can have a photo-realistic game for cheap leading to a oversaturation and potentially AAA gaming getting fucked hard.\r\n\r\nTv can potentially fuck the movie theater and tv industry cause we're now seeing the rise of internet only shows that are just as good and for much cheaper.

I think at this point it's a survival challenge of how abrasive I can be to them before I get banned or they all drop the act, I think banned may be the first thing to happen, and that seems like a far way off. Nothing really worth discussion happens, and their live-chat often breaks down into RP'ing (which some users seem to think is like the fucking Holocaust happening before their eyes) or them trying to be bullshit cute with each other.\r\n\r\nIt's becoming quickly apparent that they're all kids anyways. The cool people that were around were banned the day I met them. Though I think there's one still lurking around, he's a Retsufan like myself so he's got points above the entire lot.\r\n\r\nSo I guess I'll keep poking in, being the masochist I am and running a cheese grader along their moral platform to see how long it takes for them to feel the burn or harden up and loosen their rules.
