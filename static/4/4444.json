Just look at the new female Thor; all she really is a crybaby who constantly gets upset and fucking constantly \"misogyny\" is crammed into the story.  I would totally want to see a major AAA series with that stuff, but most of the time mainstream media even touches anything to do with it they make it absolute shit.\r\n\r\nIf there was a AAA mainstream series about genderswap and/or monster girls your best bet would be to take something that was originally a porno and make it pg-13. . . excuse me a second while I feel sick at this.  Joking aside if there was a AAA mainstream series about say monster girls your best bet would be take say monster girl quest and remove the naughty bits, but keep the undertones, for that pg-13 rating.  What I mean by this is that remove the sex scenes, just keep the monster girls trying to seduce people, remove the more controversial fetishes and such.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54f7f42f6368725ccd4f0500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"And now for a joke no one will get.\r\n[spoiler]!http://simg3.gelbooru.com//images/b5/b7/b5b7557f26b51db2d35c774d0483a590.jpg![/spoiler]","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54f7f42f6368721769ad0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54f7f3eb6368725c886f0500#post_54f7f3eb6368725c886f0500\r\nHey!\r\nHave you heard that a space probe is going to reach the asteroid Ceres sometime this month?","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"54f7f4a163687232e0270300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SeraphimDawn\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54f7f3a763687254643e0400#post_54f7f3a763687254643e0400\r\nWelp I'm dead\r\n\r\nThe Illumin4ti says so","author":"9ba2e84e636164642cc03200"},{"id":"54f7f4a36368725c88c40500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54f7f3eb6368725c886f0500#post_54f7f3eb6368725c886f0500\r\nI know.
