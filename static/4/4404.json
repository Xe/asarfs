Basically a guy was fighting one of the main female characters. His plan was to just melt off her clothes and have her get super embarrassed before he went in forthe kill. And he managed to get most of her clothes off. Problem was she wasn't embarrassed, she was PISSED OFF. So she just proceeded to tear off the rest of her clothes and beat the shit out of the guy. She said that shame has no place in a lifer or death struggle.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54f51e6663687254f3410000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!https://41.media.tumblr.com/5a14442b54237a2c9e2b62a28469384e/tumblr_neoyt0sA5m1tj6w51o1_1280.png!","author":"5239db6da4c72d22d9000358"},{"id":"54f51eaa6368725034490000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Shadow the Hedgehog\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54f51e6663687254f3410000#post_54f51e6663687254f3410000\r\n\r\nSo you also see old footage of dinasours when you stare at it?","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"54f51f8b636872070c050000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@QuasarNova\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54f51eaa6368725034490000#post_54f51eaa6368725034490000\r\nNope, but  [spoiler]you back in time in the game just to break the water chip that your vault needs.
