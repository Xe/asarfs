I believe that if you can't imagine a character just going to see a movie or whatever in their down time then you have failed to create a decent character and rather have only made a humanoid plot device, someone who exists only to move the story along.\r\n\r\nEven obsessives need something else to do, and if they don't have something else to do then that should be a major point about their character, think Leon in the film of the same name, a guy who's life is entirely doing violent things to the mob to the point that at the start of the movie he is shown just coming home from work to sleep in a chair with a gun in his hand.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to that excellent example, consider Kratos from the God of War series. Can you picture him, in the context of his own universe, actually enjoying something? Because I can't.\r\n\r\nThe difference between Leon and Kratos is that in the case of Leon we are made to care that his life is so empty. It shows how broken he is as a human being. In Kratos' case he exists simply as a delivery service for angsty violence.\r\n\r\nThe reason Two Saiyins Play led me down this path is because there is something oddly humanizing about seeing Vegeta have a hobby, especially one as innocuous as gaming. There is actually a story arc to the videos, he starts out dismissive and even contemptuous of gaming and then grows to genuinely enjoy it.\r\n\r\nAnyways, just a thought.","author":"4f41ee04945b701c41002af7"},{"id":"538eaad56368722f7f540000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@gasmaskangel\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/538ea72e6368721f3f120500#post_538ea72e6368721f3f120500\r\nHave you watched Renegade for Life yet?","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"538eac866368722de1ef0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/538eaad56368722f7f540000#post_538eaad56368722f7f540000\r\nYep.
