I can't wait to get Downey Jr.'s autograph\"\r\nBelievers, \"My god is real!  Murder any non-believer!  Slit their fucking throat's in their sleep!  Purge the world of heretics!\"\r\nNon-believers, \"That god is evil!  Murder any believers! Slit their fucking throat's in their sleep!  Purge the world of this evil!\"\r\n\r\nI have my own religious beliefs and that so I won't but in, *BUT* the one thing I don't ever pray for is for them to reveal themselves cause I know damn well what would happen if they showed himself/herself/themselves to people.  I don't ever go, \"show yourself to the world\"/\"show your prescense\" or such at any point cause I know damn well what would happen.\r\n\r\nDo I know if god/s are real?  Idunno.  Do I know if there's a afterlife?  Idunno.  Could it have been a hallucination and not real.  Maybe.  If it wasn't then which religion is right?  Idunno; wasn't very descriptive experience could be anyone, could have just been a hallucination from being dead at the time idunno.  All I know is that \"everything's going to be okay\".\r\n\r\nAnd just to prove my point about how why personally I don't think they show themself/themselves I bet you $500 that there's going to be a religious fight in the next page cause people are so obsessed with being cynical about our future that the mere idea of the human race actually making it and surviving is outright blasphemy to most people.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"550c235b6368723846ba2d00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"i came closs to dying once.","author":"54fdb3bd63687236677b1d00"},{"id":"550c23f96368720eb56e2c00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/550c22fc6368724c562e0700#post_550c22fc6368724c562e0700\r\nOK, thanks for the insight!\r\n\r\nIt's funny because I would think the same way as well.
