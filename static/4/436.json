However, the mammoth project is actually in progress already (or at least a mammoth-elephant hybrid, geneticist George Church has already transferred three mammoth gene variants into elephant cells and could have an embryo in three years).\r\n\r\nBen Novak is already sequencing DNA from passenger pigeon specimens in museums.

But they started it anyway.\r\n\r\nOnce the DNA has been sequenced from the pigeon, they want to start culturing germ cells from modern band-tailed pigeons, which make eggs and sperm, synthesize the passenger pigeon DNA, and edit the genomes of the germ cells to contain the new passenger pigeon DNA. Then they will put the germ cells into band-tailed pigeon embryos devoid of their own, wait for the band-tailed pigeons to hatch, grow up, mate, and lay eggs, which will hopefully hatch into band-tailed/passenger pigeon hybrids.","author":"50b70eeb7f123b1a02000097"},{"id":"538f80b16368721d2ded0300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@ThatRandomGuy42\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/538f7cc16368721ce89e0200#post_538f7cc16368721ce89e0200\r\n[bq=\"ThatRandomGuy42\"]\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/538f79cc6368721b3eb90100#post_538f79cc6368721b3eb90100\r\n...sonuvabitch...[/bq]\r\nCorrection:\r\n2gb video card","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"538f82326368721b51710400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/538f80b16368721d2ded0300#post_538f80b16368721d2ded0300\r\nOh come on!","author":"515ddf93a4c72d8a1f000d57"}]}
