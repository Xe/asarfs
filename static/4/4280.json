Eventually, neither group would be able to find it easy to assert much control over others as the internet grows. [/bq]\r\nPretty much.\r\n\r\nWith the majority of current wars and the last couple of ones people of power have turned out propaganda in mass media and it hasn't worked.  The propaganda that they've been turning out is following the same rule book as past wars from before the widespread adoption of the interner; rather the rules have changed and so has the game.\r\n\r\nTo use an analogy Russia, China, the USA, Israel and Syria have all been pumping out tons of propaganda, but the reason why nobody notices is that it gets drowned out.\r\n\r\nTo use an analogy think of special interest groups as like people standing on stages with microphones and speakers; how are they to make their voice the loudest if the speakers die and everyone starts booing at them?  Used to they could just pump up the speakers to 11 and tell them to shut up; now they can't.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54eec18063687212402e2c00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54eec1056368725239bf1500#post_54eec1056368725239bf1500\r\n[bq=\"mariomarc\"]\r\nKind of hard to flirt via paper mail[/bq]\r\n*Phone text MSM*\r\n*Phone calls*\r\n\r\n\"@Number1pegasus\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54eec133636872069aee0500#post_54eec133636872069aee0500\r\n[bq=\"Number1pegasus\"]\r\nNot if I don't know what your number and or mail is.
