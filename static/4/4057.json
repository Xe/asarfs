I know I have severe depression and shit, but considering all the shit it's totally justified to be depressed.\r\n\r\nI finally get my foot into the door and everyone around me are a bunch of idiots and I'm getting blamed and having to work 40 hours at home just to get shit done.\r\n\r\nI just wish I could win the lottery or some shit so I could get ahead on my debts for once and get a decent paying job; right now I'm getting paid below minimum wage and I'm doing advertising, video editing, book keeping, archival work, computer repair, computer maintenance and about twenty other things and I'm doing the work of ten people and I'm getting paid less than $7/hour and I'm getting complained at of \"why am I losing money on you?\"  It's cause not all my work is making dvds to sell so if I'm not all the time working on products to sell then that's not something that automatically brings in income; that's like saying that because a janitor doesn't sell food to people in a cafeteria that therefore the company is losing money when without a janitor your office would be covered in trash.\r\n\r\nI know it's stupid but I'm just tempted to take my paycheck and spend it all on lottery tickets cause I just for once want to get ahead.\r\n\r\n\"I'm finally getting a second chance at my finances\"\r\n*metaphorically shot in foot*\r\n\"FUCK!

My finances are crap; my brother and sister hate me cause they're such utter assholes that everyone loves me more when in reality I'm not a saint rather I try to not to be a unrepentable bastard of a person; and the only time I ever go ahead enough to try to learn what I want I got cockblocked by professors who were from the IDGA and were only there to promote the IDGA racketeering.  I'm not by any means a genius when it comes to programming, but when you have writing assignments about the IDGA, that the professor is a member of, and in order for you to complete the assignment you have to physically give the IDGA money that's a fucking problem; the assignment asked for specific information about the IDGA that was only available to IDGA members which is bullshit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI just hope my boss doesn't fire me tomorrow cause I'm so tired of all this bullshit in my life.  I don't want to be a millionaire, I don't want to be a politician or a astronaut; I just want to once not get metaphorically shot in my foot long enough for me to get my finances in order.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54e1769b6368723f334c0400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Shadow the Hedgehog\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54e176446368722ab9482c00#post_54e176446368722ab9482c00\r\nI've heard about it but haven't looked into it too much.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54e176ea63687250c0300000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54e1769b6368723f334c0400#post_54e1769b6368723f334c0400\r\nIt looks good IMO.\r\nAnd have a badass opening.","author":"5239db6da4c72d22d9000358"},{"id":"54e1773563687238fddb0800","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54e1766d63687232bdc31700#post_54e1766d63687232bdc31700\r\nI honestly don't know what to say to help.
