You fire a micro blackhole at a ship it'll tear right through it no matter what.  You fire a blackhole at a planet it's completely fucked and irreversibly; you know how in the first star trek remake movie they destroyed that planet?  Yeah; it would fuck everything over.\r\n\r\nTeleportation is possible, but the problem with it is far too much energy required.\r\n\r\nCreating a micro wormhole and breaking down a entity's atomic structure into data and sending it through is theoretically possible.\r\n\r\nI mean as in big ships wouldn't tactics wise make a lot of sense, cause if you had to get that close to a enemy they would tear into you.  Imagine if say for a battleship to fire it had to be within 500ft of a enemy; it would get torn up.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf there was space battles the two sides would be millions of miles away from each other and using fighters as a large scale net to protect the mother ship from attack.\r\n\r\nLike Ender's Game; the second war the humans won because the idea of someone attacking the mothership space wars wise was so unheard of that the aliens were in outright shock that someone was targeting the mothership and didn't know how to react to someone doing that.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"55144cad63687220d4432300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@EHAN\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55144c32636872098ed81300#post_55144c32636872098ed81300\r\nThat's what, around 25 Celsius?\r\n\r\n_Hell on earth_","author":"5007bbdf7f123b112f00023a"},{"id":"55144dba63687214a07a0f00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@PaskaNaakka\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55144cad63687220d4432300#post_55144cad63687220d4432300\r\nIt's not even 80\r\n\r\nGoddammit I live with a bunch of wimps","author":"9ba2e84e636164642cc03200"},{"id":"55144ef463687220d48c2600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@PaskaNaakka\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55144cad63687220d4432300#post_55144cad63687220d4432300\r\nArizona gets hotter.","author":"505696b47f123b37e800effa"},{"id":"55144f5b63687214a0441100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"@I@\r\n@HAVE@\r\n@MISSED@\r\n@A@\r\n@LOT@\r\n\r\n","author":"31bee2686368722a0df23600"},{"id":"55144f9563687220d45e2700","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Gizoid101\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55144f5b63687214a0441100#post_55144f5b63687214a0441100\r\nYou\r\nHave\r\nIndeed.","author":"505696b47f123b37e800effa"},{"id":"55144f9a6368721a8a650100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!https://41.media.tumblr.com/5851ae6ed6d52b694a938700424f40b8/tumblr_nltvo1bofg1t22wwxo1_500.jpg!\r\n!https://41.media.tumblr.com/7696d43c9b6a390655a64a03bb466855/tumblr_nltvo1bofg1t22wwxo2_500.jpg!\r\n!https://36.media.tumblr.com/4858f745e83bde960cafa0796263b496/tumblr_nltvo1bofg1t22wwxo3_500.jpg!","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"551450156368721558150700","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@igotnopicks\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55144f9563687220d45e2700#post_55144f9563687220d45e2700\r\n@I REQUIERE TO READ ALL THE PAST PAGES TO SEE WHAT'S GOING ON.@\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\n\r\n@ONE PUNCH MAN POST@\r\n@FULL METAL ACHEMIST@\r\n@WEEB THINGS@\r\n@SCIENCE@","author":"31bee2686368722a0df23600"},{"id":"5514503c636872098ef31800","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@igotnopicks\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55144ef463687220d48c2600#post_55144ef463687220d48c2600\r\nStill hell.\r\n-30째C?
