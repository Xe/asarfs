He's funny when he's mad.\r\nAnd to think, without Markiplier I never would've found him.\r\n\r\nAlso, got another question for you. Pretty soon, I'll be able to scrounge up enough money for another 3DS game (or maybe several). As before, I'm debating whether to get Bravely Default, Kid Icarus Uprising, or Fire Emblem Awakening. Which of those if any would you recommend?","author":"5043cdb47f123b72cc0032d3"},{"id":"54e6c6f76368724689920800","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"this is a pretty good one\":http://www.amazon.com/Pony-Friends-Nintendo-DS/dp/B000N2HF3U","author":"50a843d47f123b2e7c001359"},{"id":"54e6c73463687257eb400000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I'm bored","author":"4fdef063945b700a9d01604f"},{"id":"54e6c7646368727f965c0e00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Silent_Witness\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54e6c25963687277e8211500#post_54e6c25963687277e8211500\r\nAll three.","author":"505696b47f123b37e800effa"},{"id":"54e6c77a6368727a22381f00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Silent_Witness\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54e6c25963687277e8211500#post_54e6c25963687277e8211500\r\nHmmmmmm.\r\nKid Icarus is pretty awesome but the controls take some getting used too.\r\nBravely Default is the best Final Fantasy game in the past ten years.\r\nI never finished Fire Emblem but I've heard good things.\r\nI'd say Kid Icarus for it's INSANE replay value.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54e6c7866368722db7442500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@AppleJackFrost\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54e6c73463687257eb400000#post_54e6c73463687257eb400000\r\nI'm board 2!!!!!!!!!!!!!\r\n!http://fc04.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2013/014/6/7/fluffle_puff_tales__screaming__fluffle__by_hellbronyxendor-d5rin27.gif!","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"54e6c7fc6368725342441700","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"Mini Food Shrimp tempura and fried shrimp\":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqI0YFLAO0g#t=94","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"54e6d209636872299dfe1800","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Say what you will about Michael Bay, the man knows what makes a good shot.
