If not for the threat of mutually assured destruction then it would be a lot more tempting to just invade, butchering thousand and thousands of soldiers and civilians in conventional warfare.\r\n\r\nFor instance, when was the last time a nuclear power got invaded?[/bq]\r\nYou do realize that the immediate problem with that idea is proxy wars and that during the cold war there was a metric fuck ton of wars, genocides and that right?  Also how since the collapse of the soviet union the world is far more peaceful right?  Also how the taliban in afghanistan are/were fighting soldiers with american made guns we provided them to fight the soviet union in a proxy war and how there's a entire island of chemical weapons that the soviet union just fucking dumped a shit ton of chemical weapons in with no real security right?  Or how declassified papers talk about how the USSR was where Assad got his chemical weapons?  So yeah, dumping chemical weapons in the middle of nowhere with no security and handing terrorists guns and weapons totally makes us more secure.\r\n\r\nBefore someone goes, \"fuck america\" it's not just the usa at fault here; rather it's everyone's fault and not just the usa or russia, but countries and individuals who believed in interventionalism to fight those, \"dirty commies\"/\"capitalist loving rednecks\" and so forth.\r\n\r\nThat's like burning down a entire city just to protect a single block from a kitchen fire halfway across town.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*STOP!*\r\nIf someone here supports nuclear proliferation then I just have one single solitary question that needs answered; if nuclear proliferation makes us safe then why is it that after the collapse of the soviet union the world has become a much more peaceful place?","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5390aa7463687278be340100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5390a94263687225ec0b0200#post_5390a94263687225ec0b0200\r\nIs it a nice block?","author":"515ddf93a4c72d8a1f000d57"},{"id":"5390ab846368723f132f0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@ThatRandomGuy42\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5390aa7463687278be340100#post_5390aa7463687278be340100\r\nNot really; it looks nice, but the houses are actually cardboard backdrops.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5390ac166368723ba5ee0400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"Space sheriff Shaider\":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQkXsvxxjdc","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"5390adee6368723ba54e0500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5390a94263687225ec0b0200#post_5390a94263687225ec0b0200\r\nI did forget to mention the proxy wars, you are correct and I certainly never said it was moral.

The fact nuclear weapons would pose a threat to the rulers and not just the dumb smucks they are all to happy to send to their deaths for God, Country and whatever local desert is favorite does add an element of deterrence to nuclear weapons.\r\n\r\nTo revisit your analogy of them being like burning down a whole city to save a single block, that is a powerful incentive for the people living on the city block.\r\n\r\nNuclear weapons ultimately only make things safer for the rulers of countries with nuclear weapons, but as much as I do hate to use the term, there is a trickle down effect for the average citizens of said country.\r\n\r\nNow of course the minute some insane, fuck the world types get their hands on them _cough,_ Pakistani Al Queada sympathizers _cough cough_ all of this goes right out the fucking window because nukes are still the single most destructive and horrifying weapon ever to proliferate on this planet, they are still awful, but in the short term having them is beneficial to the country that has them and no one else.","author":"4f41ee04945b701c41002af7"},{"id":"5390b935636872222de60200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://37.media.tumblr.com/5f0621835654539603a5894ea66e63e6/tumblr_n6mirjKUcv1rz79boo1_1280.jpg!","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"5390b98a6368725524410000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@twistedmetalero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5390b935636872222de60200#post_5390b935636872222de60200\r\nI want to find this girl and shake her hand!","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"5390ba2e63687222165c0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@twistedmetalero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5390b935636872222de60200#post_5390b935636872222de60200\r\nI don't get it","author":"4fe16df67f123b13e400003f"},{"id":"5390bb67636872576fcc0400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@twistedmetalero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5390b935636872222de60200#post_5390b935636872222de60200\r\nThis girl speaks truth.
