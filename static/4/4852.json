I got my revenge too. Whenever they took my lunch, I flooded their schoolbags, whenever they left me in the dark room, Iframed them for theft. It was a battle of wits, well, only mine.\r\nEconomics.

If Math was really focused to a point. If everyone was talking in numbers would you understand it probably not.\r\n\r\nThe only part of Math that can be good is if you need a shape or something to solve with. Perminter and Area can be solved that way. However if you want a harder problem than 1+1=2.
