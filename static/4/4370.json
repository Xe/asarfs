Poison and Cammy are the only ones where I'd hesitantly state that the design is an improvement, though really it strikes me as more of a lateral move.\r\n\r\nHOWEVER! There is a strong streak of bullshit in this as a concept itself. I don't object to the representation of characters in an alternate style, however I do object to the idea that these alternate styles are somehow an improvement simply because they're more in line with the personal tastes of self righteous, prudish, moralizing prigs.\r\n\r\nOne can say that at best the original designs are absurd and impractical ones built to gratify the observer but to claim that this is wrong on the part of the designer is simply obnoxious. Art quite simply does not have to please anyone but the artist and the more I think about it the more I side with indignant, usually Japanese, devs who loudly tell such people to go fuck themselves.","author":"4f41ee04945b701c41002af7"},{"id":"54f2c9906368720f67281e00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@HJSDGCE\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54f2c8f46368727c4e220100#post_54f2c8f46368727c4e220100\r\nAlso game wise. \r\nPeople eat Pokemon.","author":"505696b47f123b37e800effa"},{"id":"54f2c99d6368724d78700f00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Princess♠Molestia\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54f2c8b46368726af4520300#post_54f2c8b46368726af4520300\r\n[bq=\"Princess♠Molestia\"]\"@Miyo\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54f2c7ab63687225575a0500#post_54f2c7ab63687225575a0500\r\nWhat did you say?\r\n\r\n!http://www.memecreator.org/static/images/templates/1070.jpg![/bq]\r\n[spoiler]!http://imgur.com/vVvd4nC.jpg!\r\n\r\nI SWEAR TO FUCKING GOD ILL GET SMALLER[/spoiler]\r\n","author":"511c09ec7f123b35980001eb"},{"id":"54f2ca31636872782c8f0600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54f2c4e163687226aa600f00#post_54f2c4e163687226aa600f00\r\nThey are kill joys.\r\nCan't people stop trying to \"fix\" things that ain't broke that don't need fixing?","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"54f2cb2c6368727a2b941400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54f2c4e163687226aa600f00#post_54f2c4e163687226aa600f00\r\nI like that version of poison's outfit.
