But if you play with your favorite pokemon instead and actually enjoy the games don't even fucking bother trying to win competitions with them shitlord\"\r\n\r\nWhat I mean by this:\r\nPokemon:\r\nWinning > Competitiveness >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> playing with pokemon you like\r\n\r\n\r\nIdunno games where it's intentionally stacked to where if you don't play how the creators want you you instantly die don't appeal to me.  I know it's a completely different genre all together, but I love LoL; I play it at least once a day; why do I love it so much?  Cause even though it's not the greatest game and obviously there are champions that are overpowered it doesn't force you to play champions you fucking despise to win.  Hell I could play adc Ahri (Ahri's my fav btw) against 5 tanks and while I would get killed a lot I could still have a chance at winning; no matter how stacked the match is you still have a very decent chance of winning.  No one is making you play Teemo and going, \"if you don't play Teemo even though you fucking despise him then don't bother playing\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI know my dislike towards pokemon is irrational, but I have no interest in ever playing the games again because I would rather lose with a pokemon I like rather than forgo any and all enjoyment for the sake of winning.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso have a joke: How does Smogon replace a bulb?  They don't; they just ban the bulb for being broken.\r\n\r\nTl:dr; I would rather lose with a character I like than win characters I fucking hate.  Imagine a game where you *HAVE* to play as characters you want to throttle to win.[/bq]\r\nIf you don't like the competitive scene, just stay out of it like I do. There are other past times to be had while playing Pokemon that don't involve having to build a \"perfect team.\"\r\n\r\nFor example, if you're more interested in the glory of bragging rights, becoming a shiny hunter is a good way to go. Pretty much anyone can do it, and there's not really any pressure in doing it unless you inflict it upon yourself.","author":"9ba2e84e636164642cc03200"},{"id":"54ee58976368722c74551700","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54ee56216368720a85502000#post_54ee56216368720a85502000\r\nYou just defined Super Smash Bros.\r\n\r\nHow many Super Smash Bros fans does it take to change a light bulb?\r\nNone.
