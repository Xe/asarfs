Then I spurn their suggestions forever from that point on.\r\nPoint is Squiggs, you don't want what's in muh braiiiin!  [/bq]\r\nI'm going to be the oddball out and say that STALKER is the most profound in the whole \"struggling in a wasteland environment\" category.  I liked fallout 3 cause at the time it was something new to the point that for a decade it defined post-apocalyptic survival genre, *BUT* the reason why I didn't like new vegas was that at the time of release it wasn't worth the price.  What I mean is that when NV originally costed $60 instead of $10 it lacked enough new things to truly make it worthwhile; it was a good game and all, but $60 for a game that is on the back-end pretty much the same just with new guns, rebalance and that?  Nuh-uh.  At $10 it's a hell of a game.\r\n\r\nTl:dr; it's a game that you buy later on cause it ages well, but not at release.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy do I love STALKER more?  Cause even though they're all extremely low budget games they have about the same number of potential gameplay hours (assuming you're playing both games on hard mode; as in around 30 hours for fallout 3 & nv for hard mode and 30 hours for stalker)\r\n\r\n\"Oh well stalker has reused maps\"\r\nOnly four of the maps are reused; your main hub, chernobyl, red forest and I forget the other.\r\n\"Well fallout is cheaper now\"\r\nStalker has always been a cheap game; the reason why the games are $40 for the three games is because the people that made the game even though the studio got shutdown due to lack of funding still want to make a Stalker 2 and eventually we'll get a stalker 2 whereas bethesda is a AAA studio therefore they automatically have money.  If a game is good then I don't mind the higher price.\r\nAlso no DLC.\r\n\r\nAlso the moral topic of stalker is actually really good; it's just subtle and doesn't club your face in with the moral topic.\r\n\r\nTl:dr of everything; if you want wasteland survival then play STALKER.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54fee4916368726e08e20800","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Was watching Seven Deadly Sins.\r\n\r\nWhat better way to hide yourself than convincing someone else that he is you and then watching over him?\r\nBecause that's exactly what the Sin of Lust did.","author":"4fe1b9f47f123b13df002976"},{"id":"54feec2f6368723262291500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I need to watch twin peeks\r\nI, like swery have never seen it\r\n\r\nExcept I'm not lying through my teeth","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"54feec986368726e089a0d00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54feec2f6368723262291500#post_54feec2f6368723262291500\r\nTwin Peeks?","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"54feef116368726b9fdf0700","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Carcass Strife\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54feec986368726e089a0d00#post_54feec986368726e089a0d00\r\n*\"twin peaks\":http://youtu.be/tsZUsnPYGss","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"54feef656368727d22b51700","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54feec2f6368723262291500#post_54feec2f6368723262291500\r\nSo you just got done watching the new Friendscast too eh!
