No.  I don't like Riven.  I play as Ahri all the time instead; sure I only get 5 to 10 kills instead, but I can still play pretty decently as her.  Do you ever only ever see Rivens on teams competively?  No; not every team in every match has a Riven or Nasus, cause the majority of players have champions that they play as cause they like them.  If your champion is underpowered, but the player is skilled enough you can still win in a competitive match; your champion can be a complete washout and still stand a very decent chance of winning if you're skilled enough.\r\n\r\n\r\nI love LoL, cause to prove my point the bots use the meta (basically imagine if pokemon bots played according to smogon) and the bots in LoL suck ass hard and everyone kicks the living shit out of them.  The person you're playing against could be completely stacked against you and you could still win if you're a skilled player.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo am I ever going to play pokemon again?
