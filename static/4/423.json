It hasn't been ruled out; it's just unlikely]).\r\n\r\nWhen you get right down to it the transistor is essentially establishing admin access; even one of the attacks is a reference to this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis does raise a question though; if it turned out the world is a simulation would it really change the fact we are alive or such?  If we are in a simulation then that's a pretty damn powerful computer to compute a infinite number of universes to the point at which those inside can not alter it.  That's like having a server that can run the entire large hadron collider's systems and be so secure to the point at which even if a individual had all the passwords, the source code and the admin left the computer unlocked you still couldn't actually do any damage.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"538d622e6368727e7c4a0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@QuasarNova\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/538d61ee6368727af4500200#post_538d61ee6368727af4500200\r\nDon't feel bad.
