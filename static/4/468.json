What I mean by this is that the first world countries constantly work for getting better military equipment and if not buying it from their allies; third world countries and second world countries get the scraps or have to massively suck up.\r\n\r\nThe irony of this is that several first world countries and such are working on \"iron man\" armour.  The reason why this is ironic is that in say twenty years all the first world countries are going to have armour for soldiers that bullets bounce off of and explosive only knock the crap out of them instead of killing them.  We have tanks that rockets literally just bounce off of; imagine soldiers having armour like that.  The reason why this is funny is think what that's going to do to war.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53935158636872775b8b0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53934b0563687276327c0000#post_53934b0563687276327c0000\r\nThe way innovations in warfare (usually) work is that you have a constant \"one-upping\" battle of those who develop weapons and those who develop means to nullify and guard against those weapons.\r\n\"Iron Man\" armour would only be just another advancement in defense (as well as a bit in offense) and it wouldn't be long until someone developed a weapon that would exploit the weakness of that armour, which would then cause teams to rally and try to \"patch up\" those weak points and develop even stronger offensive and defensive measures.\r\nIt is a self destructive system, but if it can be sustained enough, it can go on through progression for quite a while, even where - in theory - one could build some kind of world-smashing, gravitical rail-gun that fires a single particle at ludicrous speeds in just the right trajectory and put sizable dents (if not more) into the surfaces of whole planets; and in retaliation, gravity-controlling systems to stop any incoming subatomic slugs of that nature; and even build things more powerful than that.\r\nBut technology like that would be too elusive for a faulty system of warfare like ours - we'd more than likely annihilate each other long before we could develop that kind of technology.  It'd pretty much take a miracle or several to pull us through to that point.","author":"4fde0c7e945b706cc30003eb"},{"id":"53935409636872775b4a0300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@CogWeaver\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53935158636872775b8b0200#post_53935158636872775b8b0200\r\nI'm not saying that war will go away; rather war as we know it today.  For the past couple of decades it has been a extremely rare occurrence for first world countries to go to war directly with another first world country; most of those times have been proxy wars instead.
