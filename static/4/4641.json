If that makes any sense. Tired Squiggy has all the weirdest ideas. Like this one he had about Giants a while back.\r\n[bq]So I just had a thought. You know how a lot of fantasy settings have giants?\r\nAnd those giants are usually huge shitlords who just want to eat/maim/crush and generally fuck up humans.\r\nWhat if instead of trying to kill us, giants that we were super cute? Like how we look at puppies and kittens is how they see us.[/bq]\r\nOr this one about the sexual nature of Orcs.\r\n[bq][spoiler]So Tired Squiggy just had a thought. Orcs! Orcs are always portrayed one of two ways. Violent savages with no plans beyond endless conquest, or brutal yet noble warriors who prefer seclusion from the rest of the world. Either way, they're big, they're green they're muscley, and they know their way around a battlefield. What if, when it comes to sex, orcs are the COMPLETE opposite? Gentle, loving, and compassionate bordering on the timid. Like when they first penetrate they start freaking out a little because they're afraid they might hurt you. And then after you both finish (because a truly affectionate lover would make sure his partner finishes first) he asks if you want to cuddle with an adorable blush on his rugged green face.[/spoiler][/bq]\r\n","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"5503d0346368724f59910300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SeraphimDawn\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5503cee363687255ded00000#post_5503cee363687255ded00000\r\nThis is the Alternate version, the DARK Version. \r\n\r\nIt isn't supposed to be cute really though I do miss my old Avatar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"@Carcass Strife\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5503ced96368727a397a0100#post_5503ced96368727a397a0100\r\nIts fine!
