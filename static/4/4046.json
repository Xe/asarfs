What do I mean by this?  Take Kill La Kill for instance; it had fuck tons of fanservice, but was the show bad?  Not by any means; even if you cut out all the fanservice it was pretty decent, by no means was it a masterpiece but also wasn't bad by any means.\r\n\r\n\r\nExample of bad fanservice: Ride to Hell: Retribution.\r\n\r\n\r\nI know nobody wants to talk about the drama shit going on, but all the mass media's panic about sex in mass media is kind of stupid in that regard.  It smells like group think; one brilliant person accidentally says something stupid one time and everyone just falls in line.  My money is on someone at some point in time wanted to say \"sex in mass media should not circumvent the actual stories\" and instead was drunk at the time and it came out wrong and everyone just fell in line thinking it was word of god.  I've had that happen to me before where I'm hung over or drunk and what I'm trying to say doesn't come out right, but cause I'm good at debating at a podium everyone just blindly ate it up.\r\n\r\nThe funny thing is I was bombed out of my mind during one of my college classes standing on the podium during the final and even though I was so drunk that I had to rest on the podium to stand up I put it so well that everyone but one person agreed with me.\r\nThat was kind of funny, cause it literally went:\r\n\"*in a slurry slow voice*  America is supposed to be about freedom and the liberty to choose who you want to represent you; that is why you vote to have your voice heard and your voice be equal to everyone else's no matter who they are.  That is why I think the USA should have direct elections cause with electoral colleges if you live in North Dakota your voice is worthless; why should your voice in say Ohio or Florida be worth more than the voice of everyone else in the entire USA?  In states that are hard one party or the other your voice doesn't matter either cause no matter what the state is going to swing that way; are you telling me that it is better to have only people in Ohio or Florida matter and everyone else no matter who they are their voice be completely worthless?  This isn't about Republicans or Democrats; this is about having it to where the 80% of the USA that their votes don't matter and are completely considered garbage and trash matter again. . . *continues on*\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sad thing is that it doesn't matter who is right or wrong or whether or not someone is drunk cause if you put something eloquently people have a tendency to eat it up and blindly believe it.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54e102c263687214c4df0900","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54e10274636872425edb2b00#post_54e10274636872425edb2b00\r\nYou... were drunk?","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"54e103166368721514470e00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Carcass Strife\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54e102c263687214c4df0900#post_54e102c263687214c4df0900\r\nOh I was beyond drunk that day.\r\n\r\nI didn't even have a piece of paper with a script or anything and didn't even do any studying or any research; I literally just showed up to class drunk and gave the speech and after I sat back down everyone started clapping.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54e103596368726efdb21700","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://news.tokunation.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/02/StarNinger-2.jpg!\r\nThe sixth ranger for the Upcoming Ninja sentai.","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"54e103686368724a7b111300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54e103166368721514470e00#post_54e103166368721514470e00\r\nI.
