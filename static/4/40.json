The group in question is about 50 people in full russian navy getup.  Too many questions right now without answers.\r\n\r\nAre they actual russian navy?  Are they just people dressed up like it?  If so then where did they get half of the equipment?  Military equipment isn't exactly easy to come by. .  Well rather to say it's not cheap to come by; anything is easy to come by if you have money, but fifty fully armed people dressed as russian navy?  Someone is trying to start shit.  Are they russian soldiers awol?\r\n\r\nThe only thing that is for certain right now is that they're trying to start shit and they need to be stopped before shit hits the fan.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53100c266368720bc1ba0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"The Russian Navy maintains a base in Sevastopol in the Ukraine Crimea.

World Economy is today's MAD and the least it'll do is lead to an isolationist Ukraine whose only defense is the diplomatic reputation of Russia. It'd really paint them in a bad way to perform such an obvious invasion, they'd need to find chemical weapons or some shit there.\r\n\r\nBut Ukraine's in Russia's sphere of Influence. It always has been. Or it's been a part of Russia in some way. Either as a province in the Empire of Russia or as an SSR in the Soviet Union or the Russian helmed Warsaw Pact.\r\n\r\nTo invade now would be an obvious way to maintain their own sphere of influence and Russia has too high a reputation to risk and too reliant an economy on everyone else to do it. They would need to bring up a case of something else, which would lead to questions about how Ukraine got nukes or chemical weapons and who; and the entire international community would be looking at Moscow. Their reputation would still be shamed.\r\n\r\nThe most they can do is try to rattle their sabers and work diplomatic influences to try and win favor in the backrooms to keep Ukraine in their pocket. They can't invade anyone without pissing off anybody. It'd be like the US invading Mexico for the same reason.\r\n\r\nAnd if they do anything military-level to maintain order it'll probably be more clandestine and indirect.","author":"4fe4bf947f123b175b000001"},{"id":"53100f926368720eed220000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SeraphimDawn\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53100dc76368722b21880200#post_53100dc76368722b21880200\r\nMore like cold war 2.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"531096776368727dd4260000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"So.\r\n\r\nI may have just taken a ten kilometers long accidental detour while walking home because fuck you, i'm _not_ lost and i'm _definitely not_ asking anyone for directions.\r\n","author":"5007bbdf7f123b112f00023a"},{"id":"53109f6d6368722bcea10000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@PaskaNaakka\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/531096776368727dd4260000#post_531096776368727dd4260000\r\n10km, how long did it take?","author":"509129db7f123b36cb010fa5"},{"id":"5310a0156368722b32990000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@PaskaNaakka\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/531096776368727dd4260000#post_531096776368727dd4260000\r\n\r\nhey, in case you don't make it back to society, can I stay with your pony plushies?","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"5310a1b16368722ad55c0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@PaskaNaakka\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/531096776368727dd4260000#post_531096776368727dd4260000\r\nWell that's what you get for using the dirty communist metric system.","author":"4f41ee04945b701c41002af7"},{"id":"5310a2a06368722b61a10100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@boz\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53109f6d6368722bcea10000#post_53109f6d6368722bcea10000\r\nThe whole walk ended up taking a bit over two and a half hours, but hey, at least i didn't have to ask for directions.
