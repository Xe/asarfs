The reality of it is that the usa is filled to the brim with kinky geeks.\r\n\r\nCase in point:\r\nPokemon:\r\nI'm just going to admit I'm not a fan of pokemon, but the latest sales reports from pokemon show that the majority of people playing pokemon are teens/adults now.  Also the insane amounts of porn.\r\n\r\nHow mainstream culture depicts it:\r\n\"Pokemon is for children and if you look at porn of it you're a filthy neckbeard\"\r\nThe reality:\r\nThe majority of players are young adults and the porn is really popular.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is probably going to happen in the usa culturally in the next couple of years:\r\n2015:\r\n\"Fucking geeks!  Learn your place!\"\r\n2016:\r\n\"Fuck you!  Fuck you!  Fuck you!\"\r\n2017:\r\n\"You should check out our cosplay of the week vid!  It's super rad bro!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTl:dr; geeks are taking over","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54f668966368727f411b0400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Miyo\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54f6684b6368727a61410300#post_54f6684b6368727a61410300\r\n[bq=\"Miyo\"]\"@EHAN\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54f664ac6368720a01380200#post_54f664ac6368720a01380200\r\n[bq=\"EHAN\"]Can someone explain what the hell is going on\r\n\r\nI mean with just today in general[/bq]\r\nthis[/bq]\r\nare you suffering from March Madness too","author":"9ba2e84e636164642cc03200"},{"id":"54f6694b6368720ad86d0400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54f6686a6368727962a80300#post_54f6686a6368727962a80300\r\nIt is very, very much a generational thing.
