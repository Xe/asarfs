Their anger, hatred, fear, depression, and other negative emotions are what keep the Other Self going. And if your Other Self happens to DIE then all of those negative emotions are just let go. The hatred, the depression, the anxiety, all of it just washes away. The problem being that you also lose your ability to truly attach to anyone. You become an island. Carefree but alone. So one of the major ideas of B★RS, if I'm reading it correctly, is that you NEED suffering. You need to feel pain to truly understand and appreciate happiness.[/spoiler]","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"55067b7b6368725c24860b00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Urgh, Internet so slow that I can't even open Google...","author":"4fe1b9f47f123b13df002976"},{"id":"55067c3263687258e3070500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55067afb6368720c82001200#post_55067afb6368720c82001200\r\nMakes sense.
