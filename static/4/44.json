Mormons. \r\nNo sir, I have not.[/bq]\r\nGood morning sir.  Ghost in the shell is essentially the deus ex of the 90's, but far more philosophy.  It features motoko, a ex-soldier cyborg who is a police officer.  In the original movie she goes up against a ai who gained sapience and gained a soul merging together with him.  The first season of the tv show is around infamous hacker called, \"the laughing man\" who made his debut after threatening a ceo of a cybernetics company at gun point while hacking everyone's cybernetic eyes, the tv station and all people in real time and then when the ceo refused to admit his criminal actions was forced into hiding.\r\n\r\nThe laughing man resurfaces after a assassination attempt with several people trying to assassinate the same man.  When the file that proves the corruption of the political individuals involved the corrupt politicians pull strings with the military to kill everyone involved and kill the police officers investigating and kill the person who no longer can stomach his hand in what they have done.  The question is what could be so horrid that a kid would put a gun to a ceo's head telling him to tell the truth and so horrid that the military would be called into with tanks to kill a entire police department, in the middle of a major city no less, so as that it would never see the light of day?","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5312d6b163687279d13a0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5312d5b46368727bf9200000#post_5312d5b46368727bf9200000\r\n!http://weknowgifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/stop-my-penis-can-only-get-so-erect.gif!","author":"50c204917f123b31440000a5"},{"id":"5312d779636872791d5d0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5312d3a063687217f39a0200#post_5312d3a063687217f39a0200\r\nI've only seen the latter.
