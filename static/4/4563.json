Usually I can easily go without food for that long, and sure, I was feeling hungry, but I wasn't starving.\r\n\r\nSo Toski and I were going to the doctor's office for the first time since we've moved, and we got our check-ups as usual. \r\n\r\n(Apparently I'm between 5'6\" and 5'7\" which is actually a bit less than I expected, plus I'm not even 100 pounds which is definitely not what I expected, other than that I'm perfectly healthy, just small)\r\n\r\nAfterwards, the doctor suggests we get a blood test for cholesterol and stuff like that, and our mom agrees, even when I'm telling her stuff like \"I haven't eaten all day, I'm gonna pass out.\" I wasn't at all terrified of getting my blood drawn, but more so passing out afterwards, since getting my blood drawn makes me dizzy, coupled with the fact that I was especially low on nutrients without any food in my system.\r\n\r\nSo Toski went first, he was perfectly fine. Right before I stepped up though, I absolutely started crashing. My vision went completely black and fuzzy, and my hearing was muffled. I leaned up against a wall, but then I went completely weak and basically had to be held up by my mom. They sat me down for a good 10 minutes, I was absolutely pale for a while, and after that I was fine. \r\n\r\nSo apparently I'm going back tomorrow to get it done instead of today. I really need to make sure I eat XD","author":"9ba2e84e636164642cc03200"},{"id":"54ff86476368725df3640c00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Number1pegasus\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54ff85ce63687210b50d2900#post_54ff85ce63687210b50d2900\r\nThe main one I know is where in Super robot wars GC [spoiler]Have the Alex target the limbs rather than the cockpit.[/spoiler]","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"54ff868f63687230e8b50a00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54ff86476368725df3640c00#post_54ff86476368725df3640c00\r\nWell holy goddamn shit. \r\n\r\nDammit Why didn't he do that from the start!
