GLBT, disabled people, minorities and women are the most outspoken opponents of Anita, SJW, gamer+ and all those groups.  XOXO con had *0* minorities in attendance; I'm not even joking cause there's pictures of all the attendees and there was not a single fucking minority there.[/bq]\r\nYet, they shamelessly brush off their existence. Which is why people hate SJWs. No other groups on the internet are more hated than \"moral guardians\" and SJWs. They are the enemy to all groups who don't conform to their ideology.","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"54ded6f363687226fdee1f00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54ded6806368723f4a840400#post_54ded6806368723f4a840400\r\nSo Bayonetta is pretty much a superhero.","author":"500757fd7f123b75a90003b1"},{"id":"54ded71e6368722d44701200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54ded6806368723f4a840400#post_54ded6806368723f4a840400\r\nWell it's just pure ignorance than\r\n\r\nAlso the feminist crazies are not really consistent\r\nSome are all about women be free to be sexual as they like, some think any sexuality is just doing what the patriarchy wants, it's all just confusing\r\n\r\nAnd honestly I would prefer to not really keep discussing it","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"54ded7206368722d44721200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Princess♠Molestia\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54ded6f363687226fdee1f00#post_54ded6f363687226fdee1f00\r\nYup.
