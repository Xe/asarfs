Keys are used to buy rare items.\r\n\r\nAnd then you got the buds, what I would call, liiiike a hundred dollar. As of now, a single bud cost 12 keys, so I never could get one.\r\n\r\nEvery trades are done through Steam. and most trades are found on certain websites, such as TF2outpost.\r\n\r\nYou also have Steam BOTS, which are fast ways to buy/sell items, though I haven't been finding much. Seeing as you have some games that would require buying, I think you'll be fine with them.","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"54e5387a63687202c0620b00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Double post.","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"54e538db6368723da7500900","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Out of everything Gravity Falls has ever done\r\n[spoiler]!http://i.imgur.com/RCG7sSc.gif![/spoiler]\r\nThis is what makes me feel the most\r\n[spoiler]the bell[/spoiler]","author":"9ba2e84e636164642cc03200"},{"id":"54e539056368722dccf20f00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Having problem finding a Crone Dome, gotta have to go Craftable.\r\nEDIT: Oh wait a minute.","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"54e539526368724c0db00300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Michael Buble is great ","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"54e539c163687230df200f00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@EHAN\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54e538db6368723da7500900#post_54e538db6368723da7500900\r\n~THEBELL~","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"54e53a4d6368721713910200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"And now there's a full-on Ghoul CULT.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54e53a8b6368723405880200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Pegasus, I'm trying to send a trade offer, but it says there's an error and you need to invite me to trade.","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"54e53a9463687234058c0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Carcass Strife\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54e539c163687230df200f00#post_54e539c163687230df200f00\r\n~ISEVIL~","author":"536f7a11636872666e2d0000"},{"id":"54e53ad763687231ffa21100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Carcass Strife\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54e539c163687230df200f00#post_54e539c163687230df200f00\r\n^[spoiler]the tortured mind of Pacifica Northwest[/spoiler]^","author":"9ba2e84e636164642cc03200"},{"id":"54e53af463687206df410b00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Carcass Strife\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54e5383f6368726183050500#post_54e5383f6368726183050500\r\nHmmmm, I see I see.\r\n\r\nAnd so you can get these by just playing through the game?

The metals HAVE to be crafted. You can use weapons you don't want to be crafted into scrap, though you need 2. The scrap metal can then be combined into reclaimed metals, and reclaimed metals into refined metal.\r\nYou can't craft Refined Metals into Key, you have to buy them using the metal, and the key for the bud is the same for the ref for the keys.","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"54e53be4636872290f061400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Wallace go away nobody likes you","author":"9ba2e84e636164642cc03200"},{"id":"54e53bed6368721713fe0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"For being one of the most marketed things in the series, Kaneki doesn't wear his mask a lot.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54e53d11636872567eb00000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Well, that couldn't have been worst...","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"54e53d736368726a7d210100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Carcass Strife\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54e53d11636872567eb00000#post_54e53d11636872567eb00000\r\nSorry about that, Its pretty weird that they have to do that?
