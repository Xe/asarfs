If you're wondering what I'm talking about it's about hillary.  They're trying to disqualify her from politics first claiming that she had \"brain damage\" and thus was \"unfit to run for president\"; now they're claiming that cause she once didn't show for foxnews that she is thus \"unfit to run for president\" under \"failure to report for duty\".\r\n\r\n\r\nHere's a fucking idea NRC:\r\nIf you want to win the presidency then run a candidate who can win. . . . which kind of hard in your case since you have alienated women, african americans, native americans, asians, people of arab descent, the poor, the middle class, anyone who supports glbt rights, muslims, agnostics, atheists, hindu, buddhists, jewish, even a lot of christian denominations that aren't fundamentalist, the younger generations and pretty much anyone that isn't a 70 year old white guy.  I can understand how \"scary\" it is to expand your voter base, but considering your voterbase consists primarily of a group that is going to have died of old age in ten years maybe you need to do some outreach.\r\n\r\nIf you're republican or just interested in what I mean future projections of future presidential races are now predicting that the republican party due to their poor outreach will not win any presidencies for the next twenty years.
