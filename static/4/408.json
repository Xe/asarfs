I am on the fence about vaccines because while the general concept is good the execution can be bad. Vaccines are produced by several pharmaceutical companies and some are far safer and better than others. I am not against vaccines, I am against inferior vaccines that can and have caused illness and terrible side effects. This vaccine however seems to be wonderful, based on the video it has shown 100% effectiveness in human trials so far and if it provides long term protection with little to no side effects I will embrace and covet it's use by everyone who needs it.","author":"5010fa077f123b1e4f00104e"},{"id":"538c098e6368720fbff70000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Randomosaur\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/538c08ef6368720cebc20000#post_538c08ef6368720cebc20000\r\n\r\nconsidering we share dna with bananans, im not surprised.","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"538c0a106368720ed7250100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Randomosaur\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/538c08ef6368720cebc20000#post_538c08ef6368720cebc20000\r\nThat makes no sense. Why try to reinvent the wheel? We already have a Hep B vaccine. The only advantage to this is the ease of production and distribution. I think it's actually pretty cool that a vaccine could literally grow on trees but the amount invested in the I think could otherwise just to go to figuring out how to produce the existing vaccine at a lower cost or at the very least just using that money to simply make more of the vaccines.","author":"5010fa077f123b1e4f00104e"},{"id":"538c0a2f6368720f112e0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@someguy111\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/538c09456368720ed7000100#post_538c09456368720ed7000100\r\n[bq=\"someguy111\"]\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/538c07be6368720c885f0000#post_538c07be6368720c885f0000\r\nI am against inferior vaccines that can and have caused illness and terrible side effects.[/bq]\r\nThat's called a live vaccine.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"538c0aa96368720f53f10000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/538c0a2f6368720f112e0100#post_538c0a2f6368720f112e0100\r\nDon't you mean attenuated?","author":"5010fa077f123b1e4f00104e"},{"id":"538c0c5f636872108d670100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@someguy111\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/538c0a106368720ed7250100#post_538c0a106368720ed7250100\r\nIt could be successful for children, who generally like eating fruits but don't like getting a sharp needle.","author":"50b70eeb7f123b1a02000097"},{"id":"538c0d916368720f94250200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@someguy111\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/538c0aa96368720f53f10000#post_538c0aa96368720f53f10000\r\nYeah; I prefer to speak in non-technical terms for describing things cause I feel as though it makes people far more willing to debate something.\r\n\r\nAs much as I dislike when people are against vaccines I still feel as though they're entitled to their opinions and thus you should speak to them in a manner everyone can understand.
