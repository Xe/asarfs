rather what I mean by this is that biomechatronics is less than ten years from widespread adoption, ethnic plastic surgery is reaching widespread adoption and gender reassignment surgery is at a record low and continuing to drop (it's now on average only $20k whereas ten years ago it was easily $100k).  As well as a ton of other technologies coming out.  Hell the world's first head transplant is scheduled for 2017.\r\n\r\n\r\nBasically what I mean by all this is that in 2025: you'll be able to change your gender medically cheaply, but you'll also be able to change your race and look completely different.  Say sexism will be gone because people will be going \"what's a sex?\" and all actual sexists will instead be rallying against biomechatronics calling it evil or such.  Racism will be gone and instead say the kkk will be rallying against ethnic plastic surgery.  Homophobia will be gone and instead the westboro baptist church will be rallying against gender reassignment surgery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you want a short list of things coming out by 2025 that will drastically change the world's culture:\r\nSelf driving cars.\r\nAlgae biofuel.\r\nEthnic plastic surgery reaching widespread adoption.\r\nAutonomous robotic surgeons.\r\n3d printed organs.\r\nHead transplants.\r\nSynthesized food.\r\nVertical farms.\r\nWidespread adoption of designer babies (right now there are designer babies but they can only choose selected few genes and it's really expensive, but in say ten years it'll be cheap).\r\nWidespread adoption of genetic engineering in humans.\r\n70% of the minimum wage workforce replaced by robots.\r\nReprogrammed cells reaching widespread adoption in humans.\r\nNeural bridges.\r\n\r\nAnd potentially the most controversial of all:\r\n[spoiler]\r\nEctogenesis (basically goodbye childbirth say hello to children born in factories in literal factory lines)\r\nIf you still don't know what ectogenesis is here's *exactly* what it means:\r\n!http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view5/2352275/zim-s-birth-o.gif!\r\n!http://i294.photobucket.com/albums/mm87/Tehila_2008/Matrix-pod-with-baby.jpg!\r\nImagine no more child birth; just fields upon fields of literal baby factories.
