personally think the political correctness group/sjw/third wavers or such have reached the point in which they are objectively morally evil.  Why?  Cause the reason why they landed the satellite on the meteor was a proof of concept because it can in the long run prove that redirecting asteroids and such is possible thus theoretically saving every last human on the planet; even conservatively say mining asteroids can yield rare minerals and even tritium which would theoretically fix our global energy problem, provide a tens of trillions of dollars industry and provide tens of millions of people with high paying jobs and a liveable income.\r\n\r\nI had several very heated arguments with these sorts of people during shirtgate and their entire points boiled down to \"I don't care if every person on the planet dies; my feeling are more important\".  In my book if someone believes that their personal feelings are more important than every last human life on the planet that makes them objectively a morally evil person.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"}]}
