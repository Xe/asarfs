I was awake for a grand total of 14 hours and I felt like I hadn't slept in probably twice as long.\r\n\r\nIn comparison, today I slept for 6 hours, and yesterday I slept for 10 or 11.

It seems to be just past 8 hours.\r\n\r\nI can easily run on an average 5 to 7 hours, even possibly 4 hours if I have to. Anything less though is really pushing it for me.","author":"9ba2e84e636164642cc03200"},{"id":"54f37d706368722671231100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@EHAN\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54f377ca6368721c0ec10a00#post_54f377ca6368721c0ec10a00\r\n[bq]!i.imgur.com/29SK2vC.png![/bq]\r\nThis mother fucker\r\nI have literally had to start telling people my last name is dean when ordering food because nobody knows how to spell or pronounce my name","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"54f37db86368725bedbb1500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"How much do you think it actually cost CLAMP and Madhouse to have Sakura dress in different outfits?","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54f37e0b6368725e3fcb1700","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54f37db86368725bedbb1500#post_54f37db86368725bedbb1500\r\n\r\nSome basement dweller must have calculated this.","author":"5041b54f7f123b77af00a442"},{"id":"54f37e1363687235924d0c00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54f37db86368725bedbb1500#post_54f37db86368725bedbb1500\r\nIt's probably why the series is over.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54f37e2d6368725ca5580b00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@And Brother I Hurt People\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54f37e0b6368725e3fcb1700#post_54f37e0b6368725e3fcb1700\r\nIt had to have been expensive to animated using cels.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54f37e7a63687217b1f50200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54f37d706368722671231100#post_54f37d706368722671231100\r\nHis name is Dean.\r\nWe _like_ Dean.\r\n\r\n\r\n*_DEAN._*","author":"5201b5c0a4c72d0d9b0001e4"},{"id":"54f37eac6368726c63a00100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@toxicrystal\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54f37e7a63687217b1f50200#post_54f37e7a63687217b1f50200\r\n\"DAMMIT SAM WHAT IS IT?!\"","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54f37eeb6368724227001600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I have literally an Easy first name and someone pronounced it wrong.
