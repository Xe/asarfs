Seriously this is probably the slowest I have seen Sonic go. Where as most of the other games like to show you that sonic is indeed FAST.\r\n\r\nWhen Tails knuckles and Amy are literally running and keeping up with sonic at the same speed you know something is up. \r\n\r\nThe other thing is that the games world seems super empty. Like there is just nothing there. And then once again I have to say this game has NO MUSIC AT ALL.","author":"50c204917f123b31440000a5"},{"id":"54e2dbe963687249f3320900","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Princess♠Molestia\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54e2da616368726241f50400#post_54e2da616368726241f50400\r\n\r\n\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54e2db0c63687262a8450400#post_54e2db0c63687262a8450400\r\n\r\n\"@Number1pegasus\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54e2db496368723a285f0400#post_54e2db496368723a285f0400\r\n!http://i.imgur.com/Z1j2fKM.png!","author":"4fe16df67f123b13e400003f"},{"id":"54e2dc3963687246a3831200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54e2d5066368726f82e10f00#post_54e2d5066368726f82e10f00\r\nBoth are terrible on their own and in their own rights.\r\n\r\nHowever, Sonic Boom could be consider objectively worse, because one of Sonic 06's few saving graces was its great soundtrack. Sonic Boom's soundtrack is so forgettable and vanilla you can't even taste the vanilla. \r\n\r\nYes, I'm defending Sonic 06 over Sonic Boom. The only thing(s) good about Sonic Boom are the TV Show (to an extent) and maybe the Archie Comic adaptations.
