The reason why this is bad is that SteamOS is coming out soon and while SteamOS obviously won't take over the market it'll force the other other operating systems whenever a new one comes out to have to be stable thus fucking up all that money going towards cyber security.\r\n\r\nBasically windows' security is intentionally crappy; once steamos comes out they'll be forced to make not crap operating systems or lose massive numbers of users.\r\n2)Consoles in the long run are a bad idea, inb4 \"nuh-uh uc9 is a doody head\", because by 2020 a $1000 desktop computer will be able to run as many computations as a human brain.  To put it simply ten years from now you'll be able to run Crysis 3 on your watch.  Also we're so close to realistic graphics in games that you can't make games look any better now without running into the uncanny valley.\r\n\r\nThe next big thing gaming wise is VR, *NOT* graphics so ten years from now if everything including your watch can play realistic looking games at 100fps then what is the point in a dedicated machine to play video games?  Simply put if even a calculator can play crysis then why do you need a console?\r\n3)There is a market for apps, but the reason why the market is so shit right now for them is too many cooks in the kitchen; there's a fucking overload of oversaturation of money and no where near enough money.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54fcbcca6368722e5ebc0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!https://40.media.tumblr.com/dd911b5da6ec39fe90ac466ec393144f/tumblr_nayem0e46z1rjln1bo1_1280.png!","author":"31bee2686368722a0df23600"},{"id":"54fcbe62636872391f790500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Just when I thought Glocks couldn't get more ridiculous...\r\n\"MechTech Glock Carbine\":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwC4M_VInSA","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"54fcbfdb6368727210a41400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@EHAN\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54fcba066368724e8f7c0200#post_54fcba066368724e8f7c0200\r\nNo.","author":"505696b47f123b37e800effa"},{"id":"54fcbfea6368720d920e2600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54fcb8736368722e4f712600#post_54fcb8736368722e4f712600\r\nWhat happened to the other suspect?","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"54fcc3336368724927500600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SeraphimDawn\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54fcbfea6368720d920e2600#post_54fcbfea6368720d920e2600\r\nThey had a shootout with the police.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54fcc6116368722fcb5b0300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"[spoiler]Welp, Cardcaptor Sakura has successfully gotten me to cry.[/spoiler]","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54fcc619636872391f450700","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54fcc3336368724927500600#post_54fcc3336368724927500600\r\nSo is that second guy also killed?","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"54fcc6f563687237f5c60600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Alright!
