What we always do whenever it's war time is drive up our deficit, then drive up our inflation so that our deficit loses it's value and we cheat the system.  Also the whole thing with the shutdown was a bunch of whinny politicians upset they didn't get their way.  Chances are there won't be another shutdown, cause turns out it massively fucks up your approval rating and is bad for politicians to do when it's close to election year.  That's why congress approved a budget already cause it's a election year.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is probably going to happen towards the usa in the long run is that for the next two years they'll work on reducing the annual deficit bit by bit so no one freaks out then when hillary becomes president(pretty much a given she's going to win no matter what) they'll do something to bring in further revenue and then work on the deficit.\r\n\r\n\r\nRight now though a balanced budget or actually paying off our deficit would be a very bad thing economically.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5316832e6368724a95690100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I thought this thread was for wasting time?","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"531684f06368724aadf70100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5316832e6368724a95690100#post_5316832e6368724a95690100\r\nIt's more of a random chat thread.
