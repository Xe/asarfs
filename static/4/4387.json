That six hours episode illustrated what you don't ever do with autistic children in that don't ever get angry or upset at them cause if you get upset that will get them upset.  Every time it was time for me and his mom to switch out watching him she would get upset and after a few minutes tell him to be quiet to which then I would have to pick him up and tell him it was okay and that everyone was just crabby and tired.  Eventually she just called it quits for the night and left him to me and it took two hours after she left for me to calm him down cause he was extremely upset that she was upset at him.\r\n\r\nMoral of the story: don't yell at autistic children.\r\n\r\nRaising kids is okay; just takes a ton of patience.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54f3ecd163687232f13a0b00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"Yandere Clicker\":http://www.y8.com/games/yandere_clicker#","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"54f3ed946368722259340200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SeraphimDawn\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54f3ecd163687232f13a0b00#post_54f3ecd163687232f13a0b00\r\nThere is an everything in everything.","author":"4fdef063945b700a9d01604f"},{"id":"54f3edeb6368722bbb7e0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://blog-imgs-43.fc2.com/w/7/s/w7staygold/1307878728779.gif!","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"54f3ee9a63687222d02f1500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"oh\":http://awkwardsonicphotos.tumblr.com/post/111469189045/archiewhatthetails-ill-never-get-tired-of-these#notes\r\n","author":"511c09ec7f123b35980001eb"},{"id":"54f3f062636872788da50600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54f3ec9e6368725b26d00c00#post_54f3ec9e6368725b26d00c00\r\nYou should never get angry with children in general.
