A completely ruined planet with every part of its surface having volcanoes erupting radioactive waste (I think). The planet was literally glowing green with dark spots here and there. I could hewr tormented screams and agonizing wails from it. It was like the Sun but I was so close to it. It was huge and the thought of falling from the sky towards that planet terrified me.\r\n\r\nThen, there was the moon. An equally unstable place but instead, glowing red. The moon imploded in front of my eyes and its surface started to crack like an egg. I saw the core of the moon, glowing malevolently red. And then, both the planet and the moon cracked apart and started to merge.\r\n\r\nI was being pulled by the intense gravity and I was about to be buried in the core.
