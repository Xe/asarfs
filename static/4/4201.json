Also, when a movement loses momentum and is not as popular as it once was, that is a reasonable sign that the movement is dying. By the way, don't preach about ethics when you guys have the basic rundown of scumbags at times. King of /Pol/ was a holocaust denier, Aurini (the guy making the Sarkeesian effect documentary) is a self-proclaimed \"race-realist\" (racist) and genuine misogynist, like to a point where even you wouldn't disagree, InternetAristocrat was a right-wing moron and a dick who couldn't handle his own popularity, Sargon of Akkad's just a retard (he's basically King of /Pol/ without the holocaust denial), 8Chan was a site with several pedo boards which hosted CP and the creator of the site said he kept it up because it gave his site popularity... I'm sorry, don't preach to me about ethics. Even if you succeeded with Gawker, what's the end result? The lose a few advertisers. Woopty do. I guess no one in game reviews understands the inherent issue with objectivity and how it's technically an impossibility as well. Oh, and if you think I'm saying the feminists have been any better, you're wrong, this coming from a feminist, most of them have been fucking retards and made their own side look stupid.
