I  know you want a boku no hero academia anime, but chances are the creators are going right now \"we should wait a couple chapters to start on the anime cause filler episodes would not work well with the story since the manga is story heavy\".  In say 6-12 months the manga will be far enough in that they can start the anime without having to resort to filler.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"55024665636872587d050a00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Carcass Strife\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/550245bd63687225eb180200#post_550245bd63687225eb180200\r\nWho puts flashlights with more flashlights?!","author":"4fe1b9f47f123b13df002976"},{"id":"550246c163687244ee830600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/550246476368722c8b770000#post_550246476368722c8b770000\r\nI just hope Toei isn't the studio in charge of the anime.
