Second, I don't want children, so there's that obstacle. Third, I haven't found anyone who clicks with me so far (mainly due to lack of action on my part but nevertheless I haven't met many girls whose personality draws me in yet). Fourth, any girls I've ever been remotely interested in were in a relationship at the time of me being interested in them. Fifth, if all of that previous stuff I mentioned happens to turn out in my favor, they're people who are either A) out of my age group, meaning it would be weird to date someone years older/younger than me at my age, or B) in another part of the world entirely, extremely limiting my ability to pursue any feelings I have for them.\r\n\r\nSo yeah, all in all, I'm a fcuking loner, and it'll likely stay that way.
