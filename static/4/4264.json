[/bq]\r\nShort version tutorial for newbies:\r\nTier 1 & 2 runes suck; don't buy them.\r\nTanks are good against mages; Ryze is good for noobs, but if you play a tank don't get too ballsy; nothing pisses off support quite like a person giving a turret a high-five with their face.\r\nSupport is cause tanks tend to be tards and thinking they're invisible; support is there to make sure tanks don't die as much.\r\nMages are good, but attack from a distance.\r\nJungling is good, but easy to fuck up.\r\nAssassins are a more balanced tank that don't die as much, but don't have as much attack power.\r\nBruisers are overpowered, but keep in mind you're more squishy.\r\nCarry are basically range attackers.\r\n\r\nFocus on whoever is squishiest on the opposing team, make them retreat, push hard on turret while they're away, retreat when they come back, heal, then push back.\r\n\r\nAlso kills don't really matter that much other than xp and gold; as long as you try to die the least that's good.\r\n\r\nIf a enemy has a projectile attack keep moving so they can't get a straight attack; if they have a area of effect attack stay out of their range.\r\n\r\n\r\nTl:dr; Remember that you're a squishy flesh being and that a turret to the face hurts so only try to take out the turret super hard when the enemy is away healing; if the enemy is there try to take out the enemy minions so that they're on the defensive and DON'T WALK INTO ENEMY ATTACK RANGES!\r\n\r\n*Tl:dr of Tl:dr; Don't say hi to the turret with your face.  #1 mistake of new players is that they go \"oh hi Mr. Turret; would you like a hug today?\"*","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54ee62ed636872745e5f3700","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@And Brother I Hurt People\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54ee62b863687236e0160e00#post_54ee62b863687236e0160e00\r\nIt's hard being Hard of Hearing.\r\nThere are Youtubers who use their own subtitles on their videos, though.","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"54ee62fa63687208fd664100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Number1pegasus\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54ee62c663687238d7a42400#post_54ee62c663687238d7a42400\r\nYeah.","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"}]}
