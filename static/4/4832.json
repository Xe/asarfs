I don't mean he's going to touch you porn; rather I mean all the furry drama that goes on behind closed doors will have to be moderated more; I mean as in drama whores will be given harder punishments.\r\n2)Knowing drama whores they'll throw a massive fit which will get them permabanned.  I've seen popular users there upload real gore and make journals going \"fuck you mods!  I'll fucking kill you!\" then after getting banned wondering why they've been banned.  FA moderating this behaviour more means more and more drama whores will wind up leaving the site.\r\n3)Number wise theoretically the furry fandom could have gone mainstream years ago if it weren't for the drama; FA alone has about 700k active users and a lot of other furry sites have a lot of users as well; theoretically we're talking about a fandom with about a million people.  While a million members, keep in mind worldwide so therefore we're not talking about a million solely in the usa, is not a large fandom compared to say star trek it's still fairly large.  FA is the primary cause for drama in the fandom.\r\n\r\nSince my laundry just finished I'll summarize my thoughs; the drama from the late 90's and early to mid 2000's nerfed the furry fandom's popularity and retarded the growth (as in to stunt growth definition not mental deficincy definition) so in the long run furries will profit from this cause they'll have to start throwing out drama whores which were the main cause of the growth stunting.\r\n\r\nTl:dr; the main reason why people don't want to join furries is cause of the drama, most of the drama comes from FA, furaffinity will have to start throwing out drama whores now that it's owned by a large company, this will improve the image of furries and in turn make more people want to join the furry fandom.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"550cc0a06368724d022e3600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/550cbf476368721846e60100#post_550cbf476368721846e60100\r\nawww, seeya dude.","author":"50c204917f123b31440000a5"},{"id":"550cc0ed6368724a29860100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/550cbf476368721846e60100#post_550cbf476368721846e60100\r\nByes and byes","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"550cc1ac6368724a29ca0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/550cbf476368721846e60100#post_550cbf476368721846e60100\r\nOi!
