I disagree with some religions, but I'll fight for their right to exist.  If your kid is christian, muslim, buddhist, hindu, pagan or even if they're agnostic or don't believe in god at all that's fine.  It's just sickening how many people hit their kids, abuse them or throw them out for not following the parent's beliefs/non-beliefs; there's even been cases of people in the past couple years killing their children for not having the same beliefs/non-beliefs even in the usa.\r\n\r\nIt's legitimately sad that we as a race still have people that kill their children for having different beliefs than their parents or such and that we still have religious wars.  I mean look at fucking ISIS, they're throwing people off buildings, using children as sex slaves and such.  There's places in France or such where religious symbols and practices are banned; in china religious books have to go past the censorship board and have to be \"edited\" beforehand.\r\n\r\nI just wish people could handle the idea of different beliefs/non-beliefs without people going on a fucking genocide spree or beating the shit out of people.  If your kid or such is <insert here> don't fucking hit them or abuse them.\r\n\r\nIt's just kind of heartbreaking that we're still as a race not above this shit.  I mean for fuck's sakes we *had* managed to wipe out slavery from the entire world and now it's fucking back in full force.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"550c30d76368725031df1000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/550c2fea63687266adf92100#post_550c2fea63687266adf92100\r\nI agree, people should be able to have their own beliefs.","author":"54fdb3bd63687236677b1d00"},{"id":"550c32a863687250316a1100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"So a feminist, a gluten allergic and a vegan walk into a bar.\r\n\r\nWell, that's what they told everyone the moment they walked in.","author":"50d9a3aea4c72dc9b3000120"},{"id":"550c330063687259418b0a00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@NotYourAverageLurker\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/550c32a863687250316a1100#post_550c32a863687250316a1100\r\n[bq=\"NotYourAverageLurker\"]So a feminist, a gluten allergic and a vegan walk into a bar.\r\n\r\nWell, that's what they told everyone the moment they walked in.[/bq]\r\n\"11/10 Joke of the year!

Hope people come to their senses.\r\n\r\nThat not everyone is the same. And not everyone needs to be the same. And its ok to be different. And that's its ok to have different beliefs than others.\r\n\r\nUntil than it is up to the people to decide weather they want to be idiots, and it is up for the future generations to fix the mess the old ones have passed onto the world we live in today. And truly make a change in todays society. Not as a group but as individuals. We should let people have a choice. \r\n\r\nAnd respect them on the choices that they make. and not judge them if they are different from ours. Because in the end we are all just human beings that want to live our life's the way we see fit. \r\n\r\nAnd in the end is that too hard to ask? Is a world where we all can just get along just too difficult to truly obtain. Or is it just ignorance that divide us into packs. Is it ignorance that tells us others are not equal. \r\n\r\nYes, Yes it is. And that's saddening. Let go of your ignorance and see the world in an open mind. Shut off the past and look to the future. A future of true peace and a true future without suffering.  \r\n\r\n*TL;DR* For real, Just don't be an *asshole!* \r\n\r\nAlso I talk weird when I'm tired so I apologize if I sound straaaange. But I took a lot of time writing this so I didn't want to just not post it, ya know?
