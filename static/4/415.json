While people will think you are kind of nuts for being a communist, it isn't associated with cold blooded evil the way fascism is. This is because communism's evils can be laid more at the feet of specific leaders than on the system as a whole.\r\n\r\nFuck, communism as system sounds goddamned appealing. It speaks to the part of all of us that cries out in frustration at the unfairness of life. To put this in perspective, I am a libertarian telling you that on paper communism sounds like a good idea.\r\n\r\nI could get into the inherent flaws in communism that creep up on you or the lessons about its failure that history teaches, but that's a discussion for another time id anyone's interested.\r\n\r\nThe reason it gets thrown around so much is largely the fault of the way communism and Stalinism are portrayed in western media. Most of the time it is with cartoonish, mustache twirling and obvious propaganda. Defeat the Red menace and all that, which by its outdated nature makes these things look less bad. Additionally people are often reluctant to acknowledge the soul crushing evil of Stalin's regime. He's just a guy with a funny mustache! Who care's how many live he had savagely extinguished in countless pograms, how he committed atrocity on top of atrocity and built his rule atop a mountain of misery and death?\r\n\r\nIts all so distant that its easy to forget what a monster Stalin was and to just focus on that ridiculous mustache and the crude western propaganda instead.\r\n\r\nCompounding this is the fact that people are less and less willing to believe in western ideals simply because they are western ideals. In many ways I applaud this skepticism for received ideas but as a result it makes everything greyer. Communism and the monsters it allowed to rise like Stalin or Kim Il Sung become less terrible when you know your own country dabbled in genocide.","author":"4f41ee04945b701c41002af7"},{"id":"538d21b36368727fadab0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@twistedmetalero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/538d21986368727fad970000#post_538d21986368727fad970000\r\nOUR FUTURE!","author":"500757fd7f123b75a90003b1"},{"id":"538d221363687278da040100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@twistedmetalero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/538d21986368727fad970000#post_538d21986368727fad970000\r\nThe amount of done I feel in my body right now is to much.
