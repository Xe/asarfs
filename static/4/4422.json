A lot of the figures in the sjw/gamer+/anti-gamergaters are from mainstream media and culture.\r\n\r\nA problem in the usa is that no matter how popular geek culture has gotten mainstream culture still utterly fucking refuses to let geek culture bleed in and if they do allow it to bleed in they only allow adaptations of geek culture with non-geek directors, why the silent hill movie was so shit was the director wasn't a fan and such or why the transformers movies are so shit is cause Bay is not a transformers fan.  The problem is that geek culture is mainstream now and no matter what mainstream culture refuses to adopt it; the problem with this is what happens when geek culture becomes so popular that the mass media can no longer resist it.\r\n\r\nTl:dr;\r\n1990's:\r\n\"Geeks are a menace to society!\"\r\n2000's:\r\n\"Geeks are a menace to society!\"\r\n2010:\r\n\"Geeks are a menace to society!\"\r\n2014-2015:\r\n\"WHAT?!
