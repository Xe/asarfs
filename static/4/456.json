What I mean by this is that let's say you're playing poker, if you bluff every single time you're going to have people call your bluff; i.e. al qaeda not giving a shit that we have nukes and so forth cause they know we won't use them.  Nukes as a bluff are only useful in extremely specific situations; if order for nukes to actually be of any use bluffing wise the enemy has to:\r\n\r\n1)Be a country with a standing army; terrorists or military groups don't give a shit.\r\n2)Be a enemy actually capable of invading you; sorry but china and russia do not have the manpower to do so and that you don't invade russia during the winter and you don't have a ground war in china.\r\n3)They have to believe you mean business to the point they really do think you will nuke them if they go to war with you.\r\n4)You have to have a strong military force large enough for them to know you mean business.\r\n5)You have to have a military force that actually poses a threat; if you're running around with fifty year old military weapons that bounce off modern armor they're going to laugh at you.\r\n6)Walk softly and carry a big stick; what I mean by that is if someone does start shit with you have to come down on them like the fist of angry god to make everyone believe that yes you will use nukes cause if you don't come down on a enemy force like a sake of bricks then everyone's going to laugh at the idea of you using nukes.  If say Belgium threatened to use their nukes everyone would laugh.\r\n\r\nThe countries that have nukes as far as we know are USA, Russian, China, France, UK, India, Pakistan, North Korea, Israel, Belgium, Netherlands, Germany and Turkey. Excluding USA, Russia and China for #2, excluding NATO countries cause let's face if you fuck with NATO you're pretty fucked and so forth that brings the list down to only India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel.\r\n\r\nPersonally I would argue against North Korea cause let's face it they're so far behind military wise that if they did actually nuke someone it would be a act of martyrdom cause they would get utterly raped hard cause they're running around with military equipment from the 1950's.  So that brings the actual list to India, Pakistan and Israel.\r\n\"@twistedmetalero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5390be176368721a3ccd0200#post_5390be176368721a3ccd0200\r\n[bq=\"twistedmetalero\"][NSFW]\r\n\r\n[spoiler]!http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/769/408/d85.jpg![/spoiler] [/bq]\r\nWould sticking your connector into her peripheral slot still count?","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5390c482636872352e860200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"It's like I'm stuck in some awful comedy sketch.\r\nWho is Madoka!","author":"4fe16df67f123b13e400003f"},{"id":"5390c4d66368723d6b090400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Whatevs\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5390c482636872352e860200#post_5390c482636872352e860200\r\nYou can be Mami then, cause you seem head strong.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5390c543636872720f320000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Whatevs\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5390c482636872352e860200#post_5390c482636872352e860200\r\n\r\nwe are in the same here brother.\r\n\r\n[seinfeld bass line starts playing]","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"5390c55b63687226ed2e0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5390c4d66368723d6b090400#post_5390c4d66368723d6b090400\r\nWho is Green Madoka?","author":"4fe16df67f123b13e400003f"},{"id":"5390c5746368723d6b2d0400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Whatevs\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5390c482636872352e860200#post_5390c482636872352e860200\r\nI never responded because I have no clue either.

Short version: the only reason why anyone really remembers her is she got her head bitten off as soon as she started developing as a character.  The show started off as a generic magical girl show that you thought was going to be cliche about the magic of friendship then *BOOM out of nowhere she gets her head bitten off on a kid's show.
