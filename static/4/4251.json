On the band's full-length debut album On Avery Island, which followed shortly thereafter, Mangum was joined by childhood friend and Apples in Stereo frontman Robert Schneider, who contributed production and instrumentation. Upon the album's release, the full band was formed and extensive touring began.\r\n\r\nNeutral Milk Hotel released In the Aeroplane Over the Sea in 1998, which became their best-known and most critically acclaimed album.[3] Although the album did not meet commercial success at the time of release, it has gone on to sell over 300,000 copies and received critical acclaim from several publications, including Pitchfork Media, Magnet Magazine, Allmusic, and The Pazz & Jop poll.[2][4][5][6] Despite growing popularity, the group disbanded in 1999 after Mangum became disenchanted with touring and the music press, later having a nervous breakdown.[4]","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"54ed439463687209cc740100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I wonder if Death wouldn't mind me riding shotgun on his Cadillac instead of his trunk when I die...","author":"4fe1b9f47f123b13df002976"},{"id":"54ed43df636872744db41100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Twisty\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54ed42d263687238aa512e00#post_54ed42d263687238aa512e00\r\nNERRRRRRRRRRRD!","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54ed4429636872592a160300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I made a thread I've been wanting to make for a while now finally!","author":"50c204917f123b31440000a5"},{"id":"54ed4462636872744dfd1100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Number1pegasus\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54ed4429636872592a160300#post_54ed4429636872592a160300\r\nWhat is it?","author":"4fe1b9f47f123b13df002976"},{"id":"54ed446b63687215dd5c1000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54ed43df636872744db41100#post_54ed43df636872744db41100\r\n[bq=\"SquiggyBomb\"]\"@Twisty\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54ed42d263687238aa512e00#post_54ed42d263687238aa512e00\r\nNERRRRRRRRRRRD![/bq]\r\n\r\nid rather be a nerd than be particle mare :))))))))))))))))))))))))))","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"54ed453a636872051b722600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@HJSDGCE\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54ed4462636872744dfd1100#post_54ed4462636872744dfd1100\r\n\"This!\":https://derpibooru.org/dis/favorite-premise/post/54ed43816368720fd5d90a00#post_54ed43816368720fd5d90a00\r\n\r\n","author":"50c204917f123b31440000a5"},{"id":"54ed45a36368723cf99f0f00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Twisty\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54ed446b63687215dd5c1000#post_54ed446b63687215dd5c1000\r\nJust admit you want her sweet gam-gams.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54ed45ed6368723cf9a90f00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Twisty\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54ed42d263687238aa512e00#post_54ed42d263687238aa512e00\r\nI will take that as a \"I am planning to express my real feelings to her in a nerdy way\"","author":"5239db6da4c72d22d9000358"},{"id":"54ed47b263687241131b0400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Well this seems interesting.","author":"4fdef063945b700a9d01604f"},{"id":"54ed47df6368722f9d4d0d00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@AppleJackFrost\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54ed47b263687241131b0400#post_54ed47b263687241131b0400\r\nEverything is interesting.","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"54ed47fa63687209cc930200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54ed45a36368723cf99f0f00#post_54ed45a36368723cf99f0f00\r\nI want your sweet gam-gams","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"54ed4810636872051be62700","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54ed45a36368723cf99f0f00#post_54ed45a36368723cf99f0f00\r\n[bq=\"SquiggyBomb\"]\"@Twisty\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54ed446b63687215dd5c1000#post_54ed446b63687215dd5c1000\r\nJust admit you want her sweet gam-gams.[/bq]\r\n\r\n\"@Shadow the Hedgehog\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54ed45ed6368723cf9a90f00#post_54ed45ed6368723cf9a90f00\r\n[bq=\"Shadow the Hedgehog\"]\"@Twisty\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54ed42d263687238aa512e00#post_54ed42d263687238aa512e00\r\nI will take that as a \"I am planning to express my real feelings to her in a nerdy way\"[/bq]\r\n\r\ndammit i cant get you nerds off my back with anything","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"}]}
