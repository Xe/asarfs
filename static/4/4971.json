Plus, the kid was probably traumatized.\r\nSo, I guess even if the kid did remember, it wouldn't be that important since the authorities would probably find the bodies. I mean, the pizzaria had been renovated so it would be logical that they found it. \r\n\r\nAnother thing that bothered me would the Puppet or Marionette. This guy is way out of the equation and it's almost impossible to find what relation he has to the mystery. All we know (if you play the minigames correctly) is that he gave cake to the crying kid and the fact that we CONTROL him.\r\n\r\nNote, this guys is only available if you try to get the good ending. We control this weird dude with the Puppet mask through minigames and give cake.\r\n\r\nMaybe the Puppet _is_ the leader and had always been trying to cheer the crying kid up? I mean, after the third game, it's obvious that the animatronics (except Spring Trap) aren't actually evil. Cursed is a better word.","author":"4fe1b9f47f123b13df002976"},{"id":"551561056368726b44dc1500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Okay Not!Seija Kijin calmed down and cut off best girl's arms.","author":"4fdef063945b700a9d01604f"},{"id":"551562406368726c1e180900","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@HJSDGCE\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55155edf6368726be5150900#post_55155edf6368726be5150900\r\nWell, what we also know is that, in the second FNAF, his job is to give gifts to the children, as some of the drawing shows. And getting gifts make kids happy, so that's probably his job.\r\n\r\nSo, in one of the death mini games, he gave gifts to what appears to be four corpses. When he noticed they didn't look happy. He probably saw that they were dead. So, he gave them life. But, he still noticed they weren't happy yet (They're trying to get Jeremy). So, he decided to help them try to get you so they can be happy again.\r\n\r\nAt least, that's what I think about the Puppet, and what he does.","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"551566826368726bd3151300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Speaking of FNAF:\r\n!http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/918/234/333.png!","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"551566df6368726c1e7a0c00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I woke up.","author":"505696b47f123b37e800effa"},{"id":"5515670f6368726b44ff1c00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@igotnopicks\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/551566df6368726c1e7a0c00#post_551566df6368726c1e7a0c00\r\nGo to bed.","author":"4fdef063945b700a9d01604f"},{"id":"5515681c6368726ec55f0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@igotnopicks\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/551566df6368726c1e7a0c00#post_551566df6368726c1e7a0c00\r\nBUT HOW?!\r\nYOU WERE SUPPOSE TO BE DEAD!\r\n\r\n\"@Carcass Strife\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/551562406368726c1e180900#post_551562406368726c1e180900\r\nI actually like that.\r\nThat's very good. The random equation that has a small part but it is actually the crucial point of the story. If the kids were happy, the mass murder might not even had happened.
