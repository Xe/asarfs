Fowleri is terrifying. After learning about it, I decided to stay far away from lakes and ponds when it's warm. PAM is no joke, I'm just glad it's rare. Also the cracked info is wrong. N fowleri lives in almost all freshwater, not just warm, it's only when the water is warm (about 80 degrees F) that it is infectious. Also it can't live in pools or water heaters as it dies in chlorine. Only if you have well water or don't chlorinate your pool are you at risk.","author":"5010fa077f123b1e4f00104e"},{"id":"538d336c6368722e2f5d0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Randomosaur\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/538d320b6368722cfc710000#post_538d320b6368722cfc710000\r\n\r\n\r\noh goodie, more reasons to stay way from the outside in my beautifull purified house.","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"538d33926368722e2f6f0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@someguy111\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/538d31556368722e891d0000#post_538d31556368722e891d0000\r\n\"@QuasarNova\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/538d31a763687229b6290000#post_538d31a763687229b6290000\r\n\r\nClassic, One Piece.","author":"4fe1b9f47f123b13df002976"},{"id":"538d33ae6368722e46bc0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@HJSDGCE\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/538d33926368722e2f6f0000#post_538d33926368722e2f6f0000\r\n\r\nOne Piece is best pirate","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"538d33be6368722d16f70000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@someguy111\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/538d33116368722e46990000#post_538d33116368722e46990000\r\nI should get a syringe, suck up some water containing it, and then squirt the water up somebody's nose while they sleep.

Not to mention since the infection is very rare, it's thought that humans have an immunity to it, most of them anyway. Think of all the people who go swimming in lakes and ponds every year, literally millions. Only a few hundred people have ever had it in recorded history. If this were as infectious as it sounds there would be hundreds of thousands who fell ill with it. Researchers think that part of the reason the infection is stopped is the first line defense of mucous in the nose that acts as a barrier between the amoeba and the olfactory bulb which they begin to feed and reproduce in as the work their way up to the brain after crossing the BBB. Also consider that this is not a human-specific pathogen, it also affects animals such as mice. This means that it can kill a wide variety of mammals but yet we have aquatic mammals like otters, seals, and beavers that get plenty of water containing the parasite up their noses all the time. This has led some to find the animals' ways a immunity to the amoeba and after experimenting on mice they found that immunity con come naturally through ingestion and be passed through mother to offspring. So basically aquatic mammals are born immune to it which is a lead for researchers to help humans develop immunity as well.","author":"5010fa077f123b1e4f00104e"},{"id":"538d35e36368722e89430100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Randomosaur\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/538d356c6368722b1cf50000#post_538d356c6368722b1cf50000\r\nJudging how big my Afro is I wouldn't be surprised actually.
