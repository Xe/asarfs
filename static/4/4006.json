Lucky Star, that show had 4 Naked teenage girls washing together and never once felt fansercicy about it, just did it's thing as usual,[/bq]\r\nNot a huge fan of Lucky Star either but that's for different reasons, I just believe everything they do, Nichijou does better +*but again that's just me so I'm fine with it if you absolutely love Lucky Star*+\r\n\r\nBut I definitely agree, there are some subjects such as nudity that can be done well in anime without having to resort to making them extremely fanservice-y\r\n\r\nOne scene that comes to mind is from the aforementioned Nichijou\r\n!http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/847/621/556.gif!\r\nAbsolutely nothing fanservice-y about this scene, yet they're very obviously naked\r\n\r\nBut recently I saw My Neighbor Totoro, which I'll also use as an example because I think it handles the nudity subject even BETTER. There's a scene where the family is all taking a bath together, the father and his two daughters. The girls are even _outside the tub, *no clothes,*_ yet they manage to keep away from turning it into ridiculous fanservice everywhere. When that scene showed up, I was prepared for the worst, but it ended up turning out for the best.","author":"9ba2e84e636164642cc03200"},{"id":"54dec9bc636872779ab40500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SeraphimDawn\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54dec9376368726ef92e0d00#post_54dec9376368726ef92e0d00\r\nThe most really, Even the other big one, at least Envy had some semblance of logic, Envy and him were both Soldiers on opposite sides of a conflict, BUT THIS MONSTER..............","author":"509f70a87f123b77eb0004fd"},{"id":"54dec9fc6368722dbccb0700","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":">>828028p","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"54deca0863687226fd0f1e00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Shadow the Hedgehog\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54dec7cc6368725521450a00#post_54dec7cc6368725521450a00\r\n[bq=\"Shadow the Hedgehog\"]\"@EHAN\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54dec76363687214e6bc0a00#post_54dec76363687214e6bc0a00\r\nNonono\r\nThere is 11 episodes right now. \r\nI think tomorrow there is a new episode.\r\n[/bq]\r\nOk that's good to know then","author":"9ba2e84e636164642cc03200"},{"id":"54deca096368721a79960600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"Signalman's first appearance in Carranger\":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KKqdCdpVJM#t=402 (6:42 if it doesn't skip.)","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"54deca3763687204b27a0a00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@EHAN\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54dec9916368722da9050900#post_54dec9916368722da9050900\r\nBro Hoof for letting narrative trump cheap titillation?\r\n\r\n(\\","author":"509f70a87f123b77eb0004fd"},{"id":"54decb5f6368726888b70600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I drew more shit I can't show\r\n\r\nIt was just some Pokemon trainer I made up and some N-like dude -that almost classifies as a trap-","author":"511c09ec7f123b35980001eb"},{"id":"54decb9d6368725c28571300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Miyo\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54decb5f6368726888b70600#post_54decb5f6368726888b70600\r\nIs it dirty stuff?","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"54decbc56368723a699d0600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I kind of lost it when signalman told the carrangers that \"Amateurs can go eat pancakes\"","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"54decc066368725c286f1300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Miyo\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54decb5f6368726888b70600#post_54decb5f6368726888b70600\r\nShow it!\r\nWanna see it!","author":"5239db6da4c72d22d9000358"},{"id":"54decc466368725cf52e0600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54decb9d6368725c28571300#post_54decb9d6368725c28571300\r\n\r\nUhh\r\n\r\nI drew two things\r\n\r\nOne was just for design and the other was kinda shipping\r\n\r\nThe shipping one's still sfw, or at least that's how I see it","author":"511c09ec7f123b35980001eb"},{"id":"54decc83636872170b240500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54decbc56368723a699d0600#post_54decbc56368723a699d0600\r\n\"Bitch best not be talking shit about The ponies\":http://youtu.be/HCob40t8dtE?t=11s","author":"509f70a87f123b77eb0004fd"},{"id":"54decc926368724e890d2500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Shadow the Hedgehog\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54decc066368725c286f1300#post_54decc066368725c286f1300\r\n\r\nNuh uh\r\n\r\nCamera's _horrible_\r\n\r\nmaybe when I get my tablet back","author":"511c09ec7f123b35980001eb"},{"id":"54deccc56368722da9c10900","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Miyo\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54decc926368724e890d2500#post_54decc926368724e890d2500\r\n\r\n:^(","author":"5239db6da4c72d22d9000358"},{"id":"54decd0e6368727e792f0f00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Thanotos Omega\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54deca3763687204b27a0a00#post_54deca3763687204b27a0a00\r\n[bq=\"Thanotos Omega\"]\"@EHAN\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54dec9916368722da9050900#post_54dec9916368722da9050900\r\nBro Hoof for letting narrative trump cheap titillation?\r\n\r\n(\\[/bq]\r\n/) well worded","author":"9ba2e84e636164642cc03200"},{"id":"54decd2263687233dbe50500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Here's something interesting;
