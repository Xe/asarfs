Her higher brain functions gone.  Thumbs gone.  Ability to use the bathroom on your own gone.  Ability to learn new things and be able to emotionally develop gone.\r\n\r\nLet's say she wasn't killed then when she became twenty years old she would still be mentally the same.\r\n\r\nIt would have been a lot less worse, but still pretty bad, if he kept her higher brain functions at least.  If he kept her higher brain functions then theoretically a philosopher stone could have given a more human body and helped her lead a normal life, but no her life as it stands was utterly destroyed.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"551394156368725603951f00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5513918f6368725603af1b00#post_5513918f6368725603af1b00\r\nWell he did need another more stable talking chimera or he would be tossed out, and he did figure out that he needed a younger person for it to work, But even then most fucked up maniacs would have snatched someone else's kid,","author":"509f70a87f123b77eb0004fd"},{"id":"5513941f6368727ea8653900","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5513938d6368725603bb1e00#post_5513938d6368725603bb1e00\r\nnice Dr. Ock","author":"505696b47f123b37e800effa"},{"id":"551394336368722f63b10100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@EHAN\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5513933f6368725603431e00#post_5513933f6368725603431e00\r\nThe sad part is though I think they are equally as sad I cannot argue with that.\r\n\r\nBecause even though Hughes died he was an Adult.
