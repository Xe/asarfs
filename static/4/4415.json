[/bq]\r\nIt has more to do with how zenni is a sjw.\r\n\r\nHe kept trying to get people to drink the kool-aid but he kept getting his metaphorical shit kicked out of him and he would get angry that people here wouldn't prescribe to sjw ideology so he tried to get anti-gamergate to attack derpibooru as a final \"fuck you for criticizing my beliefs\" and simultaneously try to rank up in the sjw ranks, but since he is a straight white male in the sjw group he had no say.\r\n\r\nIt was kind of funny to watch his reaction cause his entire time he was a member of derpibooru he kept trying to turn derpibooru into his own personal circle jerk and he quit cause nobody would circle jerk him so he tried to throw us under a bus to get into the sjw circle jerk but since he's a straight white male he was rejected from their circle jerk so he failed at trying to convert derpibooru, he failed at becoming a part of the sjw clique and he failed to get any level of attention hence why he's become such a angry person cause he's been utterly rejected by both groups.\r\n\r\nThis is why nobody should be a part of the sjw movement because it's not a movement; it's a popularity clique and the one thing that popularity cliques don't want is anymore members in their inner circle.\r\n\r\nTl:dr; Zenni got pissy cause he tried to throw derpibooru under the bus to get popular but instead he got thrown under the bus.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54f61de263687204f90c0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@EHAN\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54f61d0c63687243c4a90100#post_54f61d0c63687243c4a90100\r\n~I read that as Google Sock~","author":"50c204917f123b31440000a5"},{"id":"54f61df963687201d51d0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Number1pegasus\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54f61db36368720c78050000#post_54f61db36368720c78050000\r\n\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54f61db86368720df7010000#post_54f61db86368720df7010000\r\n*I KNOW RIGHT?!*","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54f61e9b6368721004180000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Well hello my fellow meatbags. \r\n\r\n!https://40.media.tumblr.com/662671fdd2f581f7d6df1b18019a46bb/tumblr_nfkkwtDY0v1rljsaqo1_400.png!\r\n\r\nHow was your day?","author":"31bee2686368722a0df23600"},{"id":"54f61eec6368720e4c270000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Gizoid101\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54f61e9b6368721004180000#post_54f61e9b6368721004180000\r\nPretty good.
