I'm glad to hear this cause what happens often with harem manga is that when they reach television they make it for kids and often remove the harem aspect and needlessly inserting things that weren't in the manga or such thus butchering the hell out of it.  It's not that there's no good harem manga; rather 90% of the time when it reaches the tv the censors butcher it like jack the ripper.  I'm excited cause that 10% of harem manga that they don't butcher to make kid friendly when it does become a anime they are actually pretty decent.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is probably going to happen when it comes to ex-harem animes that remove the harem aspect to make the show kid friendly vs daily life with monster girl anime:\r\n!http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/790/037/757.gif!\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of good harem anime, but there's a lot of crappy ones cause people need to stop dumbing the living fuck out of them down and making them g-rated; making a x-rated manga into a g-rated family show makes about as much sense as taking a zombie game and turning the guns into waterguns and making the zombies just want to give you a hug or if you took a porno/adult novel and turned it into a major motion movi. . . *remembers 50 shades of gray now has a movie* . . . bad example.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5502ec1a6368726697d61100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5502e9ec63687207a6b10b00#post_5502e9ec63687207a6b10b00\r\nIt's warm alright! I don't have to use a heater or anything do to the room temperature already being warm. But just in case, I also added a bunch of blankets and placed it near a normal lamp (by near, I mean a good distance).

Some zombies hug other zombies to steal their life energy but due to the lack of life energy, they usually fail and die themselves. \"_\r\n\r\n_\"Water guns are used because the water has an irremovable and invisible microorganism that acts as anti-zombie liquid which is generally harmless to humans.
