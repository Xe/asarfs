Two enamel-creating genes are still in the chicken genome, but they are non-functional due to mutations after millions of years of evolution. However, a consensus sequence of those two genes could be deduced, synthesized, and made functional. There is still the issue of the other two enamel genes though, which are missing from the chicken genome entirely.","author":"50b70eeb7f123b1a02000097"},{"id":"538d46ac636872280e5b0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Randomosaur\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/538d45d0636872278a3e0000#post_538d45d0636872278a3e0000\r\nThey brought a virus _BACK!?_ What!?","author":"5010fa077f123b1e4f00104e"},{"id":"538d471e63687227504d0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@someguy111\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/538d46ac636872280e5b0000#post_538d46ac636872280e5b0000\r\n\"They also resurrected the 1918 flu virus.\":http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn8103-us-scientists-resurrect-deadly-1918-flu.html ","author":"50b70eeb7f123b1a02000097"},{"id":"538d478f636872237a640000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"A Bioshock question.\r\n\r\nIf Vigors/Plasmids exist, which one of those powers would you like?","author":"4fe1b9f47f123b13df002976"},{"id":"538d479d6368722845910000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!https://24.media.tumblr.com/1a17cb6bc1f101f726f1db623c72c634/tumblr_mh16b3K3oJ1r3gb3zo1_400.gif!","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"}]}
