If someone here is in a sexual relationship with their parent/child and having a offspring I would *HIGHLY* have to suggest the fetus getting tested before they're born.  Basically if say you have a 50% chance of getting heart disease stack another 25% chance on top of that; 50% * 1.25 = 62.5% chance.  If your family has a severe genetic disease I would *HIGHLY FUCKING HAVE TO SUGGEST* them getting the fetus tested.  If it's any other form of relationship the chance is insignificant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"*RULES OF MENTOS!*\":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C_Qh7NGwho","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54f644ef6368720148da0400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Why is derpibooru keep eating my comments?","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54f645576368723c0c240000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54f644b86368727f6a9f0400#post_54f644b86368727f6a9f0400\r\nSo if Albus and Ivy have a kid, it would probably be fine","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"54f6457d636872095f800400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54f644ef6368720148da0400#post_54f644ef6368720148da0400\r\nMarch Madness is being taken to a whole new meaning","author":"9ba2e84e636164642cc03200"},{"id":"54f646266368720bc6a60400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54f645576368723c0c240000#post_54f645576368723c0c240000\r\n[bq=\"mariomarc\"]\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54f644b86368727f6a9f0400#post_54f644b86368727f6a9f0400\r\nSo if Albus and Ivy have a kid, it would probably be fine[/bq]\r\nIf there was something wrong with the kid it would be because one of them had a genetic disease anyhow and not cause of their relationship.\r\n\r\nWhat I mean by this is that let's say Albus has diabetes; the child would develop diabetes *because* Albus had diabetes and not cause of their relationship and that even if he wasn't with her chances are his kid would have diabetus anyhow.\r\n\r\nTo put it simply: the people that think incest causes \"mutants\" are fucking idiots.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54f6475a6368727f0be00500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Well this sucks; I can't see anyone's new comments until I comment myself and by then I won't know if there's any new comments after that.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54f648186368721489410500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54f6475a6368727f0be00500#post_54f6475a6368727f0be00500\r\nYeah every post is one behind\r\nIt's pretty annoying ","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"54f648316368727467f10300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54f6475a6368727f0be00500#post_54f6475a6368727f0be00500\r\nBetter be fixed tomorrow.","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"54f649396368722311f10100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"And I'm just sitting here watching the gay boxing anime.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54f649bb6368727c755b0400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"You know what was a great ad campaign?\r\nWii would like to play\r\n\r\nI don't why I just really liked it\r\n\r\nThey should bring it back\r\n\r\nWii U like to play?","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"54f64a136368727a7e020300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54f649bb6368727c755b0400#post_54f649bb6368727c755b0400\r\nThat ad campaign was fucking amazing.
