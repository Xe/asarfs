Like @Whatevs said, Elsa's character arc is over and she was the focal point of the film. So either they're going to have to make up some new struggle for her, or it's going to be about Olaf. Also, there is no way they could possibly live up to the first one because it was such a hit. Whatever they do is going to either come across as half-arsed or trying too hard. They can't win.\r\n\r\nLike _Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs_ or _Despicable Me_. They were good movies (especially the former,) but when the time came to do a cash-grab sequel, it just ended up being that, because the story that the first installment had set up wasn't meant to be continued. Any extension of the story is going to feel artificial. The only thing they can do is make up a new story, and of course it's immensely difficult to do that and make it work as a sequel to the original.
