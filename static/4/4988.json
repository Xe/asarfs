Have you ever gone dumpster diving?  Have you ever had to wear clothes that were in the trash?  Have you ever had to live in a shelter?\r\n\r\nTo expand further on this does this realization that you haven't experienced a situation like that internally make you angry at yourself for lacking experience into such a situation because you want to help make things better for people but cause you haven't experienced that situation you don't understand how to improve things for people in those situations and therefore you get angry at yourself and others?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile I'm vehemently opposed to such groups here's my personal advice to people cause a lot of people in your situation don't understand the situation; if you want to make the world a better place here's some small things to help:\r\nDonate canned food to shelters.\r\nDonate clothing.\r\nDonate shampoo and soap.\r\nDonate blankets.... no seriously as someone that has been in a shelter before this is often needed.\r\nDonate laundry soap for clothes.\r\nDonate old stuff that is functional but you don't use and were about to throw out.  A tv may not be necessary, but having a tv to watch a movie after watching your mom get the shit beat out of her and you both thrown on the street is a island of mental stability and a absolute godsend.  Hell you could donate old books and it could help emotionally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere's the options:\r\nA)You donate clothing that you don't use any more thus helping the person look more professional when job searching and potentially you directly get them a job/you donate food/you donate blankets/etc\r\nB)You just want to complain on the internet instead of actually put some effort into it.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5516ed86636872736c4b0400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"+How to Start World War III:+\r\n1.
