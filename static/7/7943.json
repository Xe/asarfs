After TPP goes into effect your only options would be to either live in the country the console is manufactured, pay a huge fucking price if you live out of the country or pc cause that will more or less be unaffected.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"55b3d9e66368722be9001995","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55b3d98a6368722be9001920#post_55b3d98a6368722be9001920\r\nHow long until all the stupid old people in government die off again?","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"55b3da6563687248b00001d8","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55b3d9e66368722be9001995#post_55b3d9e66368722be9001995\r\nConsidering they're on average starting to go into their 60s we're talking anywhere from a decade to a decade and a half.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"55b3da7e6368726cd700007a","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"You know it's been like three weeks and I'm still like this\r\n!http://i.imgur.com/WOzJ5js.gif!","author":"9ba2e84e636164642cc03200"},{"id":"55b3da866368725ee9000c38","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Number1pegasus\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55b3d81b63687203db000ce7#post_55b3d81b63687203db000ce7\r\nI heard that  lot of senators are against this.
