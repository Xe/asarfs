Every year nowadays there's only like 3 or 4 decent/good shooter games and the rest are fucking Call Of Duty ripoffs.\r\n\r\nWhen I say \"Splatoon is a good game\" what I actually mean is \"thank fucking christ it's not another call of duty ripoff and it's a actually fun to play game that isn't micro-transaction riddled with dlc that is on the disc locked behind 'dlc'\".\r\n\r\nI would give it a 7.5 game wise and then add +2 points just for \"thank fucking christ it's not another COD ripoff\".","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"558b200363687221bd000d1c","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"If the cast of the Upcoming One-punch man drama CD is going to be the same as the Anime, King is going to be played by the guy who played Asura.\r\n\r\nAnd Licenseless rider is Beet J stag and Alto Saotome.","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"558b209863687212cb0001de","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/558b200363687221bd000d1c#post_558b200363687221bd000d1c\r\nWouldn't it be in Japanese though?
