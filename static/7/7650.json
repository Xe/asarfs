You know how for years certain groups of people have been saying that phone games and casual games, like farmville, are the wave of the future?\r\n\r\nWell it turns out that yes phones are a growing source of gaming industry profit, *BUT* the surge in profits are coming from non-casual games and ports to phones and such.\r\n\r\nWhen you get down to it non-multiple platform games for phones are receiving year over year less percent gain of the video game market because phone ports are more profitable and such because making a purely phone game doesn't have enough returns.\r\n\r\nI don't think we'll ever see say multiplayer games come to the phone because of the latency issues, but games like minecraft, metal slug, final fantasy, etc are slowly taking over phones.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo simplify it: the future of phone gaming is ports like minecraft for phones because purely phone platform games aren't returning enough of a profit versus crossplatform games.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"55a757d563687274c10013a2","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"sup fuckups","author":"37e5b9d66361642500af5e00"},{"id":"55a758486368724d5500041a","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55a75667636872540d0022a9#post_55a75667636872540d0022a9\r\nIt's certainly darker than the Toku version.
