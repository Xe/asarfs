The show's creator and voice for a character sexually assaulted people working at CN, and he has been fired and banned from the studio. \r\n\r\nAs much as I dislike the show, this is terrible.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Looked at some articles concerning it. The sources I'm looking at seem to differ. Some seem to imply that it was more than one female coworker whom he assaulted, others say that it was only one. So I'm honestly not sure.\r\n\r\nActually, it seems like they haven't gathered any substantial evidence to prove that he did this yet; however he apparently has some sort of history of doing things like this? It's bit of a mess.

I just want to know what exactly he _did._ Sexual assault is such a broad term. And, like I said before, a lot of sources are saying that there's a lack of proof behind the supposed assault.\r\n\r\nNot that I can really blame the victim for not wanting to talk about it to the general public.","author":"5041b54f7f123b77af00a442"},{"id":"53b5dcca63687270026b0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"There needs to be an open world game with a similar gameplay and environment to FC3, but with dinosaurs.","author":"50b70eeb7f123b1a02000097"},{"id":"53b5dd016368721c3cc90200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Randomosaur\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53b5dcca63687270026b0100#post_53b5dcca63687270026b0100\r\nThere was.
