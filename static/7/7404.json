Well it was a bit about virtual reality.  Basically a tech news site I follow was talking about why virtual reality in the short run will fail but in the long run be incredibly successful.\r\n\r\nFor brevity's sake and that I'm drinking right now and can't be bothered to type it all out I'll summarize:\r\n1)Facebook and all the large companies investing in virtual reality have no fucking clue what they are doing.\r\n2)They're pushing commercial versions out already when it's too expensive right now.  $300 for vr headsets is not a good idea.\r\n3)VR development has devolved into a metaphorical pissing match between the companies rather than financially planning it out.\r\n4)The people in charge of development have no fucking clue what people want; facebook thinks people want to have virtual offices to play in after they get home from work.\r\n\r\n*In the short run* all the vr systems will probably flop hard cause the AAA companies currently working on it have no fucking clue what they are doing financially or developmentally.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd here is the interesting bit: what is probably going to drive the development of virtual reality in the long run and in the long run make it popular?  Easy porn.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make it short \"why would porn drive the development of virtual reality?\"  Easy: if the AAA companies are pissing away their money on hardware development expecting people to be buying the oculus to play \"work simulator VR edition\" at home then that's a hell of a developmental vacuum.  What you have to understand about the porn industry is that it's more of a cooperation industry rather than a competitive industry.  When sales of porn started going down rather than cutting each other's throats to win they essentially worked together to try to figure out how to keep the industry from falling any further, and now the industry has stabilized cause they worked together.\r\n\r\nWhat might happen essentially is chances are we're going to see porn companies working on developing vr together rather than against each other.  I don't necessarily mean open source so much as freeware software that they all work in conjunction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTl:dr; porn might drive the development of virtual reality cause AAA companies are pissing away their money on stupid shit and pissing away their money on marking their territory rather than making sure the fucking device has any game support.  The porn industry however is using their money smarter and cooperating to make porn games.\r\n\r\n\"@hype\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/559de04c6368727de100049a#post_559de04c6368727de100049a\r\nYou do realize we were fucking with you right?
