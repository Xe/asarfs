I have this like urge right niw to just complain or be bitter about something. [/bq]\r\nTo be fair most people like complaining; it's why pro-gamergate and anti-sjw are winning cause what are gamers really good at?  Complaining.  Gamers are good about complaining about nintendo; they're good at complaining about sony; they're good at complaining about microsoft; they're good at complaining about pc; they're good at complaining about games they like; they're good at complaining about games they don't like; they're good at complaining about bad games; they're good at complaining about good games.  Anyone that paid even the remotest attention to what happened with Mass Effect 3's ending controversy can tell you there's nothing that can stop gamers when they're no longer complaining about each other but instead complaining about something they universally hate.\r\n\r\nCoupled with the fact that when you think about it gamers are from day one programmed to not give in and win third wave feminists picked the worst fucking opponent in the worst possible arena.\r\n\r\nIf you break it down math wise third wave feminists have literally spent over a hundred million dollars combined trying to get control of gaming and they're losing.\r\n\r\nIf you want any chance of winning you don't pick a fight against someone that can outlast you by a long shot, you don't pick a fight on their home turf, you don't pick a fight when you're drastically outnumbered and you don't pick a fight when you don't have any allies.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Tl:dr; don't pick a fight with gamers on their home turf cause gamers like to complain and gamers vastly outnumber most political interest groups cause there's hundreds of millions of gamers so picking a fight with hundreds of millions of people is not smart*","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"559f162063687237ab0008ef","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Paris_Tuileries_Garden_Facepalm_statue.jpg!\r\nGoddamnit, I'm an idiot.\r\nI didn't realize that there was a different Washington beside the state.\r\nMy mother just explained it to me.\r\n...\r\nWell, that explains why the ride was shorter than expected.","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"559f162763687248960002ee","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Awake","author":"51a2815b7f123be59500049b"},{"id":"559f163e63687237ab00090f","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/559f1235636872417a0002b3#post_559f1235636872417a0002b3\r\nBerserk is one of those Manga's where we all know its good but duuuuude.
