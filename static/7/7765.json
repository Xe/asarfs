Honestly, the anime feels like the author was reading 1984 or watching Demolition Man and basing the anime on those works. But it's not really 1984 or Demolition Man:The Anime, but it does get that vibe from me.","author":"554d477e63687270dee30600"},{"id":"55ac3b2263687202ff000278","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Virgil Stormblade\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55ac3ac06368721c34000650#post_55ac3ac06368721c34000650\r\nso its a dystopian anime?","author":"4ffbfff37f123b072a01bb5b"},{"id":"55ac3b62636872109c0001ff","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@And Brother I Hurt People\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55ac35236368725131000119#post_55ac35236368725131000119\r\nOh god","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"55ac3bf8636872483b000b69","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@MoogSourceVermona\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55ac3b2263687202ff000278#post_55ac3b2263687202ff000278\r\nIt's has more Demolition Man influences than 1984 influences from what I've seen. Here's the backstory of the anime. Japan has pretty much gone FullCensorship, banning porn and even lewd words like penis or vagina. But the country at least has high moral ranking. If you forget the fact that you can get SWATTed just by looking at porn. And the fact that there's a politician who wants every person in the country to be monitored for every second of their life if her goal's reached.","author":"554d477e63687270dee30600"},{"id":"55ac3c0d6368720878000306","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55ac3b62636872109c0001ff#post_55ac3b62636872109c0001ff\r\nDeath Face is worse than Mai-Chan and its done by the same guy","author":"4ffbfff37f123b072a01bb5b"},{"id":"55ac3c406368721c34000865","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Virgil Stormblade\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55ac3bf8636872483b000b69#post_55ac3bf8636872483b000b69\r\nyeah thats very dystopian","author":"4ffbfff37f123b072a01bb5b"},{"id":"55ac3c78636872098400097e","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@And Brother I Hurt People\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55ac35236368725131000119#post_55ac35236368725131000119\r\nI heard about that one a long time ago.

Also, the main character's father is considered a terrorist because he opposed this crazy shit, and the main character is ostracized by it, and is traumatized so much that he pretty much hates his father for doing what is essentially the right thing.","author":"554d477e63687270dee30600"}]}
