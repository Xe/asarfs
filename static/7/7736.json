This is a massive jump in science because it means vastly better neural network simulations.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou know moore's law?  Ever hear of the phrase \"every two years the number of transistors we can fit onto a area doubles?\" or what bullshit 24/7 news calls \"our technological level doubles every two years?\"(as in full of shit).  Apparently Moore's law has been untrue since 2002 and soon will bunk all together.  Apparently the number of transistors we can fit onto a area has been doubling every year and 3/4ths not every two years and they've managed to make transistors that are only a couple atoms wide several years in advance.  Effectively we'll probably have atom sized transistors in 3 years not 5 years.\r\n\r\n\r\nAi stuff cause I have a large hardon collider for that and find it smashing (science joke; although it doesn't really fit this particular occasion): anyway you know how I talk about Ai development?  With the development of transistors that use light instead, quantum computing, memristors and it's becoming more of a programming problem than a hardware problem.  It's just a ballpark guess people have estimated but we have about a 70% chance human level intelligent Ai will become a reality somewhere inbetween 2030 and 2045.  It could happen sooner if there is a massive dumping of money into development; which considering how all the tech industries just dump craploads of money into shit that isn't even close to ready yet isn't that crazy.  It could happen later if people start legally banning development and throwing programmers who work on it in jail.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"55ab4b476368725a9b002a5f","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Shadow the Hedgehog\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55ab48566368721474000fcb#post_55ab48566368721474000fcb\r\nI can understand that.\r\n\r\nI don't get upset when it comes to Death battles mostly cuz I try to just enjoy them for what they are.
