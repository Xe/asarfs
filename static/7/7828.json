If you go overbudget that's really fucking bad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf anything I'd argue that companies and people in charge of game development having a nasty habit of not knowing how to budget their time, work or money is one of the reasons contributing to the rise of digital downloads.  If your game is on a physical disc if you miss your target date that's a shit ton of money down the drain superhard; I'm not talking a couple thousand dollars or that, I'm talking about potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars just flushed down the toilet overall cause if you miss your target date then all the companies that you sell through have to change their distribution and such, then the retailers have to as well; there's a lot of money money lost if you miss your target date.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"55ae542963687251b80020c1","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55ae522b63687234ff000503#post_55ae522b63687234ff000503\r\nI got it.
