Beyond that the only way forward is to force yourself to write, and to accept that you are going to write garbage. \r\n\r\nYou say that your friend specifically wants to get into screenwriting. In that case I'd advise him to get copies of the scripts for movies he likes. A lot of them can be found in bound form on amazon, and tell him to just start writing screenplays. That little ditty I slapped out on this last page? Started entirely by the phrase \"The screaming was getting worse.\" popping into my head and just rolling from there.\r\n\r\nHowever for specific books on writing I recommend these two: \r\n\r\n\"On Writing\":http://www.amazon.com/Writing-10th-Anniversary-Memoir-Craft/dp/1439156816/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1437365638&sr=8-1&keywords=on+writing by Stephen King is an _excellent_ place to start. He goes over some of the basics of getting to grips with writing that have really helped me as a writer, including re-iterating the advice I've already given regarding reading and writing constantly.\r\n\r\n\"The Elements of Style\":http://www.amazon.com/The-Elements-Style-Fourth-Edition/dp/020530902X/ref=pd_bxgy_14_text_z is more of a text book guide to formatting and grammar. While I don't believe in editing as you write, this book is very helpful when going back over text you have written and finding places where you can improve for clarity and enjoyment.\r\n\r\nI'll close this out by repeating my advice from before because I do feel really strongly on this.\r\n\r\nREAD CONSTANTLY. WRITE CONSTANTLY. These are the only guaranteed ways to improve.","author":"4f41ee04945b701c41002af7"},{"id":"55ac7712636872658e001156","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"But my hope will never die-DUBSTEP\":https://youtube.com/watch?v=YBJhzfvdyKw","author":"513e68eda4c72d4e3b000164"},{"id":"55ac77236368725bc00014a0","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SidewardManatee\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55ac76ab6368725016000504#post_55ac76ab6368725016000504\r\n\r\nSame as Last Action Hero\r\n\r\n\r\n\"@Meresflut\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55ac76d3636872658e0010f8#post_55ac76d3636872658e0010f8\r\n\r\nEstan los de nenepil, longaniza, campechanos.","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"55ac7729636872501600056f","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Virgil Stormblade\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55ac739f636872102200043d#post_55ac739f636872102200043d\r\n[bq=\"Virgil Stormblade\"]\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55ac73726368725bc0000ebf#post_55ac73726368725bc0000ebf\r\nCan it be possible to have a robot that thinks like a human? Can it?[/bq]\r\nNot in the traditional sense.  A lot of groundbreaking development has been made in Ai development as of late because to put in to generic terms people are no longer trying to simulate every fucking neuron in a human brain in a traditional computer but rather put consciousness in a way that computers can understand.\r\n\r\nTo use an analogy think of human consciousness as like windows operating system; robots as like linux; you can't just take say Bioshock and run in it in linux and expect it to just out of the box work.  You can run Bioshock and indeed a fuck ton of games in linux if you have wine or such.\r\n\r\nThe reason why the analogy is relevant is that the \"it's impossible\" crowd are wrong is that it would be like saying that unless you run Bioshock in a virtual operating system it's not \"truly bioshock\".  It's impossible for a computer to think 100% like humans cause in order to do so you would have emulate all the atoms in the human brain in order for it to work; the virtual operating system analogy.\r\n\r\nIt's possible for computers to think in a similar fashion to humans, deep learning, by taking how we think and putting it into a form that a computer can understand.\r\n\r\nThe other reason why the \"it's impossible\" crowd is full of it is because of organic networks; basically it's possible for organic cells to think in a similar fashion to computers.\r\n\r\n\r\nTl:dr; I'm going to disagree here for a second with Ghost in The Shell on the meaning of death and the emulation of consciousness and say that while it's impossible to with our current level of technology to emulate every subatomic particle in a human brain it is however possible to create a computer program that thinks in a similar fashion.\r\n\r\nTl:dr of tl:dr; Deep learning is basically taking human concepts of thought and putting them into a format that computers can understand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course even though deep learning is making huge strides people will continue to claim that cause deep learning doesn't emulate the entire brain that therefore it's not actually learning. . . Of course those people are among the young earthers and anti-vacciners crowd cause they take things they don't understand and argue from that cause they don't understand the process that therefore they are correct.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"55ac775f6368725bc000151e","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I think I might go see Antman again.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"55ac77636368725bc0001529","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@gasmaskangel\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55ac770b636872658e001148#post_55ac770b636872658e001148\r\n\r\nThanks gasmask, and sorry for the inconvenience","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"55ac778c636872658e00121d","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55ac7729636872501600056f#post_55ac7729636872501600056f\r\nDo you like Ghost in the Shell?","author":"554d477e63687270dee30600"},{"id":"55ac77a26368726e070010ea","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55ac775f6368725bc000151e#post_55ac775f6368725bc000151e\r\nYou probably should.","author":"554d477e63687270dee30600"},{"id":"55ac77a2636872610a0012e5","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55ac755d6368726e07000db7#post_55ac755d6368726e07000db7\r\nHere's the thing you need to understand: I really don't think that anything I wrote was that weird.
