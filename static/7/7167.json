Call me crazy, but I have a feeling in say 10-15 years we're probably going to see people going \"I miss how teens were constantly getting pregnant and marrying out of wedlock!  Times were better back then!  We didn't have any of this planned pregnancy by parents that can financially support their children!  We had rampant stds as well!  We're living in a sinful world with their low teenage pregnancy rates and low std rate!\"[/bq]\r\nI've always wondered this kind of thing\r\nA world so nice, it almost gets boring\r\nBut that's why we have fictional media to show give us unpleasant stuff","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"5592ded5636872447f000ea4","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Shadow the Hedgehog\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5592dddb636872447f000d8f#post_5592dddb636872447f000d8f\r\n\r\nMiralo de esta forma, nuestros asilos tendrán wi-fi y consolas.","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"5592df12636872537e001a84","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@QuasarNova\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5592ded5636872447f000ea4#post_5592ded5636872447f000ea4\r\nSi pero ya no tendremos pension.\r\n","author":"5239db6da4c72d22d9000358"},{"id":"5592df376368720ef4000b14","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Twisty\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5592de846368720d3f0005de#post_5592de846368720d3f0005de\r\n[bq=\"Twisty\"]never mess with finland\r\n\r\n!http://puu.sh/iIudC/a1d33dd88f.png![/bq]\r\nCase in point:\r\n!http://cdn.damninteresting.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SimoHayha.jpg!","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5592df846368725e790001d1","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5592de89636872419500103b#post_5592de89636872419500103b\r\n\r\n\"@Kaz\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5592deb16368724195001061#post_5592deb16368724195001061\r\nIt's just a storm at the moment.
