Well I got the stupid idea on reading up how things will turn out in the world in our lifetime and I haven't read this many books in quite a while.\r\n\r\nIf you are ever wondering if we're going to nuke ourselves as a species, go extinct, society collapse or so forth then probably no.\r\n\r\nWhat I mean by this is that a bunch of the main factors that often contribute to war in the next couple decades become irrelevant due to changes in society and technology and that the long term trend war wise is that the world has become a far more peaceful place over the past 20 years and will continue to do so until the war economy can not sustain itself anymore.\r\n\r\nWhat I mean by several of the main factors of war becoming irrelevant is that a lot of the socioeconomic factors will become irrelevant.  Essentially what I mean by this is that the worse off people are and less food and water and money they have the more likely shit is to hit the fan.  The reason why these factors are going to become irrelevant in the next couple of decades is that current changes in technology have the potential of drastically reducing the cost of living across the board thus reducing the likelihood of said factors causing a war.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't just apply to war or such; rather the lower the standard of living for individuals the more likely they are to do things like violent crimes and robberies.  The thing is though is that thanks to technological changes coming soon the cost of living on average is going to massively go down thus will probably reduce the likelihood of said crimes and so forth.\r\n\r\nWhat does this mean?  Well essentially in ten years you're going to start seeing widespread adoption of certain technologies that will drastically reduce the cost of living and certain technological advancements that will drastically change the world then over the course of the next couple decades things are going to get better.\r\n\r\nTl:dr; the more food people have on the table the happier they are and the less likely they are to do something drastic.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore someone goes, \"Well what about the people who lose their jobs cause of advancements in technology?\", I'm aware of this; I didn't say the world 50 years will be joy to the world and everyone skipping and holding hands singing, rather it will be far far far less likely for there to be incidents.  There will always be things like murder or war in the world, rather fifty years from now there will be far far far less acts of aggression in the world than there currently are.  So less of \"peace on earth\" rather war and such will become a rare occurrence that rarely happens.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53b8ea38636872664e9c0500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53b8e89863687266ca4a0400#post_53b8e89863687266ca4a0400\r\nPeace can get boring.
