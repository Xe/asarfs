Today we know that's a bunch of crap cause humans didn't come from one ancestor, but rather that we had dozens of ancestors and that cause we all fucked and pop comes homo sapiens.\r\n\r\nWhy is this important?  Well now that we have genetic engineering, we're working on biomechatronics, we have small scale printed organs and such basically pretty soon we're going to have our hands on the equivalent of a billion years of evolution as a lab tool for consumers that want to look \"cool\" or such.\r\n\r\nWhat do I think is going to be after cybernetics?  Probably synthetic biology.  What do I mean by synthetic biology?  If we develop synthetic biology then \"evolution\" is reduced to a metaphorical software update.\r\n\r\n\r\nTl:dr; I wouldn't be surprised if in say 500 years \"humans\" aren't genetically human, but rather still to some degree look \"humanish\" cause if you give people the ability to change their genetic structure every which way and replace out every part chances are the majority of people will choose to be changed based on looks rather than performance.\r\n\r\nTl:dr of tl:dr; It's more likely that people will want to be walking around with say bunny ears rather than have say twenty arms and I doubt people in say 500 years will look completely different cause most people would rather look good than be able to jump a building.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"559c3a3a6368720204001170","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55990171636872544d001ee8#post_55990171636872544d001ee8: You could do that BEFORE Awakening.
