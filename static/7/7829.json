His father just passed. And it looks like everyone in the world knows it...except him. He's at a play rehearsal right now. _He has no idea._ I haven't stopped sobbing. I really didn't know the guy well, but he was always smiling and happy. None of my friends even knew that he was THIS sick because my boyfriend didn't talk about home much. And above all, I'm just sad. Sad for my boyfriend, sad for his middle brother, sad for the younger brother - only four, I think - who will have a hard time remembering his dad. And I'm _scared._ They're really poor, they can't take the hit of a funeral and a loss of income (as horrible as it sounds for me to speak that way of him). I'm scared that my boyfriend is going to drop out of school to support them, and I'm not even sure if I could blame him if he did. I'm just so scared, guys.","author":"5041b54f7f123b77af00a442"},{"id":"55ae7a446368724f8600480a","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@And Brother I Hurt People\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55ae79d96368724c54003e14#post_55ae79d96368724c54003e14\r\nOh god\r\nI don't know ","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"55ae7a846368725f78002c12","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55ae7a446368724f8600480a#post_55ae7a446368724f8600480a\r\n\r\nIt's fine.

It's the reason why we didn't know how sick his dad was in the first place. Hell, we _still_ don't know what he was sick with. If we press into him, he'll only retreat further. It's tricky.
