It's just a really fucking bad idea to do so because as far as we know there's no evidence of parallel timelines so time travel would be a metaphorical bitch to not fuck up.\r\n\r\nIf you travel back to before you are born then chances are you would wipe yourself from existence entirely.

A sound comes out of the amp and the to the microphone and a cycle is created. This results in that high pitched sound you hear when you do this. Eventually, it will become so intense that it blows your amps.\r\n\r\nNow imagine the 'wormhole scenario of my previous post. I think the same thing would happen only instead of sound we get radiation. Radiation from the future will travel back into the past. Then to the future until your time machine blows up.","author":"52f0834d63687261cba90300"}]}
