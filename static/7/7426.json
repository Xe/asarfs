I read the entire first trade paperback.\r\n\r\n...I didn't like it.

I haven't read a lot of thor, but I don't remember him ever acting like that. Especially to his wife. Freya is shown as really wise and kind, while Odin is just mad and rude.  Hmmmmmmmmmm....\r\n\r\nIt takes alot to get me to call something a Mary Sue, but fem Thor really did have Sue qaulities in the writing. She could beat up enemies single-handed, with little experience, that the avengers couldn't as a team. And the hammer flew around far better her than it ever did for thor...cause.\r\n\r\nAlot of things seemed to be arranged to show her as awesome, at the expense of other characters. Odin suffers this haaaaard.\r\n\r\nThen there's the anvilicousness of issue 4. the one with absorbing man on the day I'm quite sure he went to a straw mill.\r\n\r\n\r\nI found myself wanting to know more about thors journey than hers. Him accepting that he no longer wields the hammer, coming to terms with this shattering event.\r\n\r\nThe writing is okay. Just okay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGonna go read Ms Marvel to get this taste out of my mouth.
