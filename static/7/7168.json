We were travelling in  car through east germany, and for some reason the car was one of those holocaust vans where you could redirect the exhaust fumes in the back where we were sitting. The driver did exactly that by accident, and then crashed the car when we started making noise about it. Everyone in the delegation ended up with their brains splattered all over the place because we didn't have seatbelts.\r\n\r\nIn the second dream i was chilling with a couple of friends in an airport where there was a massive riot going on, with people burning russian and latvian(?) flags for some reason.\r\n\r\nIn the third dream, i went to see a movie with my sister about a ghost plaguing some rural town in america. The ghost would possess people and get them killed in accidents in an effort to relive its own violent death. The ghost was finally removed with the help of estonian islamists using kirlian photography.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwat","author":"5007bbdf7f123b112f00023a"},{"id":"5592f2ce63687213d8003312","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5592f1e763687234d6000bfc#post_5592f1e763687234d6000bfc\r\nJust swelling \r\nI'm ignoring it pretty well til tomorrow ","author":"51a2815b7f123be59500049b"},{"id":"5592f30e6368725947000098","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@PaskaNaakka\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5592f2a063687258a200089e#post_5592f2a063687258a200089e\r\nAre you on _the drugs_?","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"5592f34a63687213d80033d0","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SidewardManatee\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5592f2ce63687213d8003312#post_5592f2ce63687213d8003312\r\nThat's good.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"5592f35d6368724750000c80","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5592f30e6368725947000098#post_5592f30e6368725947000098\r\nI wish i was","author":"5007bbdf7f123b112f00023a"},{"id":"5592f3606368722bea0002b1","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Ok.
