Honestly I reccomend this series because unlike many, many harem comedies I actually find the protagonist quite likable. Normally I find them to be something of an irritant, but in this case the guy comes off like a relatively sane, rational and decent young man confronted with an extraordinary situation.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I quite like the world building of the series. I always find broken masquerade stories interesting. I like seeing how the world adapts to the presence of supernatural weirdness when its out in the open.\r\n\r\nOn top of that I really like just how much thought went into the assorted quirks that go into the monsters themselves. Things like how Miia is coldblooded, and how this actually gets play in the story as opposed to just being a fact introduced and then ignored.\r\n\r\n\r\nI always watched the first episode of Gate, on the reccomendation of the Superbestfriends podcast. So far its been pretty interesting as it pits the armies of a grimdark fantasy world against a modern military with exactly the results you'd think would happen.","author":"4f41ee04945b701c41002af7"},{"id":"55a8879263687263b6001019","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Number1pegasus\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55a8871663687263b6000f6f#post_55a8871663687263b6000f6f\r\nAnd the ending.
