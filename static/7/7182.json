Your arms and legs can take far more damage than your head.  Considering I've been hit by speeding vehicles twice it saved my from any broken bones.\r\n\r\nIf you fall down stairs tuck and roll sideways.\r\n\r\nIf you're falling from a high height tuck and roll sideways while guarding your head.  Shattered legs and arms are better than a shattered spine.  Don't try to be stylish; stylish = dead.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you're getting tasered you contract your muscles as hard as you can.  Tasers work by causing your muscles to rapidly twitch and untwitch.  Nothing says \"fuck your shit\" like grabbing the taser from them.\r\n\r\n\r\nHyperventilating before holding your breath can drastically improve how long you can hold your breath by minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\nMilk can rinse out pepper spray.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you ever get impaled for the love of god don't pull it out.  Whatever has impaled you is like a cork for your blood; if you pull it out you're going to bleed much faster.\r\n\r\n\r\nRadioactive fallout seeps into fabrics; if there's ever a nuclear winter get a latex/rubber fetish.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"559360d9636872388d001248","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@QuasarNova\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/559360566368723cd9000192#post_559360566368723cd9000192\r\nDoes Arc-V make up for the major suckage that was ZEXAL?","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"559360f6636872382d000c72","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/559360d9636872388d001248#post_559360d9636872388d001248\r\n\r\nHell.

Alcohol thins your blood.  It makes for a good wound disinfectant, but don't drink it.\r\n\r\nEspecially don't drink alcohol when you have a concussion.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso the human body can handle moderately irradiated water, but if you have radiation poisoning you needs lots and lots of clean water and wine.
