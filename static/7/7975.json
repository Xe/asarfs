What I mean by this is that while windows 7 isn't amazing microsoft is having trouble getting people to upgrade.  I believe a fifth of windows users still use windows xp.  The problem with microsoft right now is that no matter how good windows 10 is chances are pretty high that people will still hang onto windows 7.  The reason why the timing couldn't be any worse is that with steamos around the corner they have to give customers a very good incentive to upgrade to windows 10.\r\n\r\nWhile I don't think everyone will just switch over to linux overnight more than likely the majority of people will just stick with windows 7 and a fair chunk of people might migrate to steamos given that steamboxes sold out so fast.\r\n\r\n\r\nTl:dr; worst timing ever for windows 10 launch","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"55b54ee0636872180d0000b2","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@QuasarNova\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55b54e0f636872236000131b#post_55b54e0f636872236000131b\r\nI know it is.\r\n\r\nThat's why I rigged your house to self destruct.
