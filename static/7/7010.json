In scifi 99% of the time robots kill all humans, but personally what I think will happen is more along the lines of Deus Ex: Mankind Divided.  Luddite ideology, the belief that technology is essentially evil, has gained a lot of ground the last couple decades and they've gone progressively more and more crazy as time has gone on.  Eventually shit is going to hit the fan.\r\n\r\nIf there is eventually a traditional humans vs cyborgs/androids war I think what go down is:\r\nLuddite side, \"It's not enough that we try to criminalize technological development; we have to force others to be pure!\"\r\n\r\nI would have to side with the androids cause chances are the \"human\" side would resort to physically ripping out pieces of someone to make them \"pure\" and replacing it with lab cooked body parts to \"purify\" them.  If there was a movement to \"purify\" \"unpure\" people I definitely would have to side against them cause imagine someone in a dinky basement taking off things you need to live the reattaching mismatched body parts to make you \"better\" like frankenstein.\r\n\r\nEven if it doesn't come to war that would be horrifying people taking off parts of you that they don't agree with then attaching a left foot to your right ankle or such for the sake of \"purity\".","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"558872ea6368723f63000f19","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55887183636872106b0011ea#post_55887183636872106b0011ea\r\nIt sounds like just a summer bug.
