I mean, you can tell that he's not trying to put up an act. He's legitimately happy that his dad is out of pain. Which, yeah, I get, but not even a tear or two. He even insisted that we got out of the house to go to a burger place. Apparently, his line of logic is that he already knew what was going to happen a week or so ago, and got his tears out then. Weird, but if he's happy...\r\n\r\nIncidentally, it's _really_ hard to find a \"sorry for your loss card\" that's not inherently sad.\r\n\r\nMe and my best friend ended up going to his home. It felt like something out of a horror movie. When you scaled the stairs to get into his living room, thirty family members were all standing in the living room practically yelling a prayer that apparently ensures that the deceased soul rests in peace. The fact that it was in perfect unison, sung in some places, and all in a language I didn't understand made it kind of scary. He didn't really want to listen, so we hugged his mom (poor women was barely keeping it together, her grip was like steel) and we just talked in his room. His brother has absolutely no semblance of social skills (my boyfriend's pretty sure he's somewhere on the autism spectrum, but since they don't have the money to confirm that suspicion and the school sure as hell won't...) and started blasting Nicki Minaj's Anaconda, to which my boyfriend just gave him a look. And his poor baby brother. You could tell he had no idea what was going on.\r\n\r\nTL;DR, my boyfriend is weirdly okay. I guess everyone mourns differently. Thanks for your support.","author":"5041b54f7f123b77af00a442"},{"id":"55af98fb6368724a1c0000cd","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@And Brother I Hurt People\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55af97d763687270b6002518#post_55af97d763687270b6002518\r\nHe knows his father is in a better place now.

I get that. It's just weird that he's not only happy, but practically _bubbling._\r\n\r\nBut if he's happy, I see no reason not to be.","author":"5041b54f7f123b77af00a442"},{"id":"55af9d9263687270b6002d52","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@And Brother I Hurt People\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55af9b4263687230ed000540#post_55af9b4263687230ed000540\r\nWhat.

I mean, don't get me wrong, he's not skipping saying \"yay, my dad died of leukemia\". It's more like \"my dad wouldn't want me to be sad, so I'm going to remember him before he was sick and do fun things with my friends\".
