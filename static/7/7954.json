There was shit going on at home and it became too much for you to handle all at once. The only thing you can do is take things in stride and make progress in a way that works for you. \r\n\r\nThis is sort of tangential to the current conversation and maybe I'm completely wrong but I had that feeling of being such a huge failure because I stopped going to school for so long and it's awful. Yes, going to school is important but keeping yourself from being absolutely miserable can be just as important. Just so long as you're always making progress whether it's school, helping at home, a job, art, anything.

I stopped going to school after things just became to get to much.\r\n\r\nCouldn't really deal with it anymore.
