The reason why a fuck ton of usa laws aren't enforced is that the justice department, nor local police departments have the capability to enforce a lot of laws.\r\n\r\nWhat I mean by this is that from a legal perspective you would think the usa is 1984, but in reality the reason why it's not is because on the local level a lot of smaller cities pay for their bills with car tickets or such cause the states are strapped for cash all the time cause the national government foots the bill for national programs by dumping everything on the states; the states in turn have to pay for national programs and take care of their own shit as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is probably going to cause the usa in the long run to become extremist anti-authoritarian in practice is self driving cars.  The reason being is that the way individual cities a lot of the time pay to put people in prison is by footing the bill with car tickets, that's why your average car ticket is flipping expensive, if there's no more car tickets then local governments literally can not afford to put anyone in prison except for violent criminals anymore.\r\n\r\nIt's just a guess, but considering how much of local governments pay for jails with car tickets that's going to be a paradigm shift with self driving cars.\r\n\"@hype\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55a6fb1b6368720f930024a5#post_55a6fb1b6368720f930024a5\r\nCorrection: legal in 10 states; misdemeanor in a lot of states.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"55a6fc19636872245a00161f","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"oh yeah, i've heard that spitting on the sidewalk here is against the law\r\n\r\nman am i glad cops aren't that big of assholes to arrest for that, i do it all the time","author":"50a843d47f123b2e7c001359"},{"id":"55a6fd26636872245a0017e0","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@hype\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55a6fc19636872245a00161f#post_55a6fc19636872245a00161f\r\nwannnnnna listen https://soundcloud.com/ninja-coyote/up-to-be-down","author":"37e5b9d66361642500af5e00"},{"id":"55a6fd8d6368722296000a22","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"in a sec, i gotta finish this ep for the third time","author":"50a843d47f123b2e7c001359"},{"id":"55a6fdf063687268660002e3","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"Here's the OP for Gangsta.\":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITOmVcOzfCo","author":"554d477e63687270dee30600"}]}
