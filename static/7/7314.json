IQ tests tend not to be used to measure how smart you are at everything, but more, the aptitudes that your brain developed up to the point you're at the time and see if there's a major drawback in an area that's obstructing your development in some task/activity or vice versa, that you developed a skill beyond the norm, in which case, could be something to get focused on to give you a higher advantage on that field.\r\n\r\n\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5599b7976368724bbe0001c6#post_5599b7976368724bbe0001c6\r\n\r\nJacques!","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"5599b8106368725d8a0001cd","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5599b7786368724bbe00019b#post_5599b7786368724bbe00019b\r\n!2.bp.blogspot.com/-v99QW-tMA5E/Upj3G7YhFdI/AAAAAAAAAyM/FHEGRjp-UQ8/s1600/fish+climbing+a+tree.jpeg!\r\nWhat now Einstein \r\nWHAT NOW","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"5599b8366368724bbe0002b0","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@QuasarNova\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5599b7da6368726901000c91#post_5599b7da6368726901000c91\r\nNah, not copyrighted enough","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"5599b8506368724bbe0002db","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5599b7786368724bbe00019b#post_5599b7786368724bbe00019b\r\nGuess Einstein was ahead of his time.
