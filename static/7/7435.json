I thought of something moderately related.  It has to do with marriage in general; the biggest driving forces currently why people are getting married less and having less kids is that in developed countries getting married and having kids is fucking expensive; one kid in the usa costs around on average $245k to the day they turn 18 and don't forget to factor in marriage costs as well.\r\n\r\nThe people that go \"the reduction in children is merely a short term fad\"/\"the reduction in people getting married is merely a short term fad\" are utterly full of shit.  After the recession hit even after the recession ended birth rates continued to drop for years and it has only just recently increased by a whopping 1%.  If it wasn't for immigration the usa's population would be entering freefall.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyway to wrap it all up into a nice little package: the main driving forces behind the reduction in marriages and children being born is because marriage and raising children is fucking expensive.  When we do eventually have \"companion bots\" or such you'd have to be higher than the ISS to believe it won't effect birth rates or marriage rates at all since what is currently driving down marriage and births is economic reasons.\r\n\r\n\r\nTl:dr; watch Chobits","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"559f215863687248960012f3","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Awake.\r\nHaving fever really sucks.\r\n!http://orig01.deviantart.net/fa01/f/2013/146/f/6/that_s_how_i_met_him_by_pyrusmerlyn-d66o0zy.jpg!\r\n\r\n","author":"5239db6da4c72d22d9000358"},{"id":"559f216663687272a1000f8c","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Number1pegasus\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/559f20bf6368724896001214#post_559f20bf6368724896001214\r\nThis _is_ a kid's book series.\r\n\r\nBUT HOLY SHIT DID YOU SEE THE PRAYING MANTIS FROM A SHOCKER ON SHOCK STREET LIKE HOLY FUCK I LOVE THIS MOVIE ALREADY.","author":"5201b5c0a4c72d0d9b0001e4"},{"id":"559f218663687279d20004b0","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SidewardManatee\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/559f212e63687201ee000e75#post_559f212e63687201ee000e75\r\n\r\nYou damn lizard people!!\r\n\r\n","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"559f219b63687201ee000f19","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/559f213563687241fc000227#post_559f213563687241fc000227\r\nShit no!\r\n\r\nYou learn me things!
