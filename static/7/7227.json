Mulan's struggle to find her identity was endearing yes but there were so many things that were just out of place. Mushu being one of them. Now don't get me wrong I love Mushu but it feels like he came out of a completely different movie. If they just cut the dragon and the ancestors all out and just made it about Mulan herself Mulan would have been MUUUUCH better. Not to mention the sheer amount of lazy writing in Mulan. The burning village scene is the biggest offender of that.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"559619136368720df1003caa","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55961898636872434c001d33#post_55961898636872434c001d33\r\nHey at least it wasn't Mulan 2. \r\n\r\n","author":"50c204917f123b31440000a5"},{"id":"559619746368726ceb0013ee","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Found this:\r\n!https://derpicdn.net/img/view/2014/9/8/718003__safe_tumblr_lyra_lyra+heartstrings_bon+bon_sweetie+drops_sword_pun_parasprite_artist-colon-atlur.png!","author":"5201b5c0a4c72d0d9b0001e4"},{"id":"5596199e6368723857004c5e","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@toxicrystal\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/559619746368726ceb0013ee#post_559619746368726ceb0013ee\r\nI love this Blog!","author":"50c204917f123b31440000a5"},{"id":"559619cf6368726ceb001477","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Guh \r\n","author":"51a2815b7f123be59500049b"},{"id":"559619cf6368726ceb001479","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Number1pegasus\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/559619136368720df1003caa#post_559619136368720df1003caa\r\n\"@toxicrystal\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/559619746368726ceb0013ee#post_559619746368726ceb0013ee\r\nNow don't interpret this as me saying Mulan is bad.
