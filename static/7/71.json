Shooting at you own civilians when they’re down… Just... Why?. It makes sense to me why these people want to distance themselves from Russia. The Ukraine was behind the Iron Curtain for the better part of a century, and Ukrainians want to form a relationship with Western Nations that were either never part of the USSR or became independent after its collapse. They’re pushing for change, but they get bullets in response…and I’m not saying Russians are bad or that they’re still harsh communists (although there is still a communist party). I’m just saying that I can understand why a country’s people wouldn’t want to be associated with a government that was oppressing them just over 20 years prior.\r\n\r\nThis is getting into madness.","author":"5239db6da4c72d22d9000358"},{"id":"5328ae356368726118170000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"WHY IS THERE SO MANY ENGLISH COMMENTS IN COLOMBIAN VIDEOS?\r\n\r\ndid my country suddenly made english official language?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qfrwd3HDNcY ","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"5328ae62636872395f230000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Shadow_the_Hedgehog\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5328a9646368727bd5520000#post_5328a9646368727bd5520000\r\nWhat's even more fucked up is that russian forces have seized a base on the border of russia that wasn't even part of crimea.\r\n\r\nAt this rate there's probably going to be a war.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5328aeb46368723b212c0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@twistedmetalero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5328ae356368726118170000#post_5328ae356368726118170000\r\n\r\nI know that feel...","author":"5239db6da4c72d22d9000358"},{"id":"5328aebd636872104e000000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"It occurs to me that only the Northwest chunk of the country is Ukrainian ethnically.\r\nThat will be a problem","author":"4fe16df67f123b13e400003f"},{"id":"5328afc0636872395f570000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Whatevs\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5328aebd636872104e000000#post_5328aebd636872104e000000\r\n*. . .* double OH CRAP!","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5328daf06368722568140000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I think I have mastered the art of wasting time.
