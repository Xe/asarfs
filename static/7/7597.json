What I mean by this is stop fighting other advance species and instead do a PR move and advance developing species.\r\n\r\nSomething like:\r\nBorg, \"Your species has barely developed writing and let me tell you something.  There are advance species out there that have the capability of curing all your diseases, giving you free food, making it to where you don't have to die just cause your body thinks you're past reproduction age.  They don't care; they think they know better cause you're beneath them.  We're offering you to join us so that you don't have to die just cause some pretentious federation thinks you deserve to die just cause they think they know better.\"\r\n\r\nIf they were to go to the sick and dying and cure them and only assimilate those who want to it would be really hard to fight them at that point cause if you managed to kick them off a planet you would then have a bunch of angry natives throwing stones at you.  If you were to destroy them completely you'd have a bunch of really fucking pissed off planets.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"55a4a3816368722f350004d0","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@ToskiHero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55a4a10c6368723972001c23#post_55a4a10c6368723972001c23\r\nThis reminds me.\r\n\r\nIn One-punch man, While the fights themselves are ridiculously one sided and quick. That doesn't mean that there isn't conflict.\r\n\r\nEveryone doubts Saitama's skill as a Hero due to his appearance. And the people who have seen his skills first hand usually either can't accept it due to the aforementioned reasons or immediately try working to meet/surpass him, Which really doesn't work.
