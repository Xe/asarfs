What I mean by this is that if the fighting spills over into Turkey(the fighting is getting pretty damn close to Turkey) we're all going to get dragged into this regional war and we wouldn't even be able to ignore it cause ISIS is thinking about declaring holy war so yeah shit's hitting the fan in the middle east.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53b887d5636872647fd00100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53b8879163687263c0660100#post_53b8879163687263c0660100\r\nMore war\r\n[sarcasm]_Yaaaaaaaaaaaay_[/sarcasm]\r\n","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"53b8888063687265a6f80100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"The next GTA game should have children in it.","author":"50b70eeb7f123b1a02000097"},{"id":"53b88883636872647f150200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53b8879163687263c0660100#post_53b8879163687263c0660100\r\nWhile Ebola is happening.","author":"513e68eda4c72d4e3b000164"},{"id":"53b889a463687264a49f0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"What a wonderful time to be alive.","author":"5007bbdf7f123b112f00023a"},{"id":"53b889d263687265cff30200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Randomosaur\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53b8888063687265a6f80100#post_53b8888063687265a6f80100\r\n:S","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"53b88a006368726528b20200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Equestria Daily is derpin' right now.","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"53b88bfc63687265b8c80300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53b887d5636872647fd00100#post_53b887d5636872647fd00100\r\nIt gets worse in that we wouldn't be able to bail out like we did in Iraq.  We would *HAVE* to stay until the fighting stopped and let's face it it's the middle east, when are they ever going to stop fighting?\r\n\r\nIf it does happen we're talking a 20+ years war.\r\n\r\nThe way it's probably going to go down is that the fighting will start spilling over into Turkey and potentially other countries; at first it'll be a war to contain ISIS' expansion, but as time goes on they're going to get more and more powerful until we have to go in there and then say hello to decades upon decades of war.\r\n\r\nThe entire middle east has been a powder keg waiting to go off and it's now been lit. . . No; we can't ignore it either anymore than ignoring a stick of tnt in your pants makes it any less of a explosion.\r\n\"@Ore-O\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53b88883636872647f150200#post_53b88883636872647f150200\r\n[bq=\"Ore-O\"]\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53b8879163687263c0660100#post_53b8879163687263c0660100\r\nWhile Ebola is happening.[/bq]\r\nHonestly; that's probably the only thing at this point that can prevent the shit from hitting the fan.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53b88c056368726594ac0300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!https://33.media.tumblr.com/02d0e6b725860042c30e2b8991fecca9/tumblr_n5qnf2jvxK1tc93gao1_400.gif!","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"53b88ca96368726594fb0300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"*AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!*","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"53b88cfc63687263af1f0400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"The next GTA also needs to bring back the fast food eating gameplay from SA.
