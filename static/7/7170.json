Easy: metal helmet.  If someone with enough money were to drop tens of billions of dollars on such a suit all you would need to do is use a bunch of thick ass oven mits to grab a lose electric cable then shock them in the head (please don't grab electric cables); the electricity would roll around in the person's body and catch their hair on fire and potentially explode the person's head inside the suit like a watermelon being exploded by a fire cracker.\r\n\r\nEven a tazer could take the person out; just smack them in the head with a tazer and having a thousand volts roll around in their brain wouldn't kill them but it would send them to the emergency room with the person convulsing on the floor.\r\n\r\nTl:dr; metal helmet + electricity = bad idea\r\n\r\nIt's also why we don't have power armor like in Fallout.[/bq]\r\nEh, the helmet just need something that could protect the head from the electricity. Something simple, like rubber or something.\r\nAnd the armors will be only in for wars. Who will bring a giant electric cable to the battlefield anyway?","author":"5239db6da4c72d22d9000358"},{"id":"55931b9a6368726a08000169","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55931b536368721e08001cb1#post_55931b536368721e08001cb1\r\nIt's still a genuinely fascinating movie and the good parts vastly outweigh the bad parts though.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"55931bdb6368725958000efc","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Shadow the Hedgehog\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55931b986368726a08000166#post_55931b986368726a08000166\r\n\r\nOne word: Railguns","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"55931c9863687260db000300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5593196163687267d1001c92#post_5593196163687267d1001c92\r\nWhen you get down to it's not that certain types of superheroes couldn't be done, but rather you would make it all of two seconds in the real world.\r\n\r\nIf batman existed you would get shot in the mouth.\r\n\r\nInvisibility *MIGHT* in a couple decades be possible with optic camouflage, but then you could just pop on thermal goggles and you would show up like a sore thumb.\r\n\r\nGuns > martial arts\r\n\r\netc\r\n\r\n. .
