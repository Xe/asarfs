I'm not going to watch that!  That movie looks shitty!\" and thus movies will eventually be forced to put feathers on their dinosaurs.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"559e7a3263687262b60030b5","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@HJSDGCE\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/559e7949636872220f0060bb#post_559e7949636872220f0060bb\r\nThey didn't ask for reality, they asked for more teeth.","author":"5201b5c0a4c72d0d9b0001e4"},{"id":"559e7a7663687262b600311e","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/559e7a0a63687272ff0001ec#post_559e7a0a63687272ff0001ec\r\nThat's too bad.
