When you get down to it the amount of information has drastically increased versus say 50 years ago.  Even if you adjust inflation into the amount of money needed for propaganda to be effective versus the amount of information generated the amount of money you need to be effective increases exponentially.\r\n\r\nBasically: the more information generated = the more money you need to spend on propaganda to continue to be effective.\r\n\r\nThe problem with traditional propaganda is that it's no longer effective in first world countries just because of the shear mass of information being generated.  While yes giving money to political interest groups is a good way of getting a large payback the amount of payback versus the country's total worth is ever increasingly diminishing.\r\n\r\nTl:dr; the more information a country generates and consumes and the higher it's production is the harder it is to maintain absolute control.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"559e0ebb63687224a600023f","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"hi\r\n\r\n","author":"554915cc63687272d8e40000"},{"id":"559e0ecb6368724df0000b1f","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Albus Fahrenheits\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/559e0b9f6368726f2900004d#post_559e0b9f6368726f2900004d\r\nsame\r\n\r\neveryone knows pulling on a dog's ear is the way to do it","author":"50a843d47f123b2e7c001359"},{"id":"559e0ee96368724df0000b59","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Toffee\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/559e0ebb63687224a600023f#post_559e0ebb63687224a600023f\r\n'Sup?","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"559e0f0963687231ce00160a","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"hi\r\n\r\n","author":"554915cc63687272d8e40000"},{"id":"559e0f236368725fc3000ac9","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/559e0ee96368724df0000b59#post_559e0ee96368724df0000b59\r\nnothin\r\n","author":"554915cc63687272d8e40000"},{"id":"559e0f526368724df0000bf3","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/559e0ee96368724df0000b59#post_559e0ee96368724df0000b59\r\n[bq=\"SquiggyBomb\"]\"@Toffee\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/559e0ebb63687224a600023f#post_559e0ebb63687224a600023f\r\n'Sup?[/bq]\r\nThe ceiling.\r\n*rimshot","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"559e0f6e6368725fc3000b39","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/559e0e9e63687224a600021c#post_559e0e9e63687224a600021c\r\nBut corporations have the money.
