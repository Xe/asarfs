Other than that, every anime I've watched has either been with a preference to the dub, or watching the sub because no dub existed at the time of watching.","author":"9ba2e84e636164642cc03200"},{"id":"559c72e56368721a00000c0b","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Wall Street Journal has accused the Malaysian Prime Minister of transferring US$700M from the state-owned investment fund 1MDB into his personal account.\r\n\r\nRight now, I don't know what and who to believe. At one side, we have Wall Street Journal receiving false information sent by someone that probably only heard a rumor. On the other, if proven true, we have a corrupted government who's leader is selfish and had used funds made for the development of the country for his own greed. \r\n\r\nAt a third side which probably exists, we also probably have someone in Wall Street Journal that doesn't like the country and tries to sabotage it by undermining the country's economy and political trust.\r\n\r\n\r\nBasically, it's confusing as hell right now. Wall Street Journal refuses to show evidence of the alleged corruption and criticizes the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister accuses WSJ for showing false information and demands an apology, which they refuse to give.\r\n\r\nThey're just pulling two end of the rope right now.","author":"4fe1b9f47f123b13df002976"},{"id":"559c73216368721fe0000378","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@HJSDGCE\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/559c72e56368721a00000c0b#post_559c72e56368721a00000c0b\r\n\r\nThis can't end well.","author":"5041b54f7f123b77af00a442"},{"id":"559c734563687239df0002c3","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!https://40.media.tumblr.com/f50a9527ed6e230de1dbd334ec77f66a/tumblr_nqxi9ylLoh1rvs136o1_1280.jpg!!https://41.media.tumblr.com/78645c6298e6c171ba81ca664d0253a3/tumblr_nqxi9ylLoh1rvs136o2_1280.jpg!\r\n\"Japan made this this Kawaii as fuck\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pikaia","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"559c73d46368721fe0000460","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@And Brother I Hurt People\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/559c73216368721fe0000378#post_559c73216368721fe0000378\r\nIt'll go a whole lot worst.","author":"4fe1b9f47f123b13df002976"},{"id":"559c73d763687242de000c85","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/559c734563687239df0002c3#post_559c734563687239df0002c3\r\nLooks more like a sea angel to me\r\n!https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/Sea_angel.jpg!","author":"9ba2e84e636164642cc03200"},{"id":"559c73ea6368721fe0000471","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/559c734563687239df0002c3#post_559c734563687239df0002c3\r\n\r\nThat looks like a pokemon.","author":"5041b54f7f123b77af00a442"},{"id":"559c74116368726689000182","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Summer wars is from the guy who directed wolf children and one of the digimon movies right? \r\nBecause the real world looks a lot like the former and oz looks a lot like the Internet from the latter. \r\n\r\nIn fact love machine seems a whole lot like the digimon that was loose on the Internet in the movie","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"559c74296368721fe00004d5","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Carcass Strife\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/559c6ef863687265650014a8#post_559c6ef863687265650014a8\r\nim the only cat here","author":"558c791d636872248d000542"},{"id":"559c747763687242de000d73","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@candycats\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/559c74296368721fe00004d5#post_559c74296368721fe00004d5\r\n\r\nNot so.
