It's been 16 years since shit started going down so almost all of the people who are responsible for giving the fandom the bad reputation are gone.  For years the fandom was in decline then around 2007 the popularity has shown consistent slow growth and in december there was a large scale spike then it's showing larger growth.  Basically imagine popularity vs time as like a long U shape.  I'm not saying in five years or such it will be popular, but in the long run it might be considering how growth seems to be getting larger rather than slower.\r\n\r\nTl:dr; in say 10 years furries might become popular; my money is on 10-15 years, it *MIGHT* be 5-10 years but don't get too excited.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"558f15db6368725b2a0000c2","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/558f155163687245320006c5#post_558f155163687245320006c5\r\nCrossing fingers for a renaissance of cool shit like swat katz\r\n\r\n","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"558f166863687241c90002a6","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Number1pegasus\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/558f14e46368724532000606#post_558f14e46368724532000606\r\nOne of Joel's Genesis Mario bootleg streams.","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"558f16d16368722469001c45","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/558f15db6368725b2a0000c2#post_558f15db6368725b2a0000c2\r\nIt's just opinion, but considering that furries and fnaf are cool with each other that might bump up furries popularity by proxy.\r\n\r\nIf Fnaf movie is popular it might by proxy increase popularity of furries.\r\nIF the Fnaf movie is popular enough to warrant a second movie that would further increase the popularity by proxy.\r\nIF it's so popular that there's a third movie then I'd argue that would make furries widely popular by proxy.\r\n\r\nIt might or might not happen depending on whether or not the movie is successful.\r\n\r\nTo use that would be like how Dragonballz/pokemon/sailor moon,etc made anime popular in the usa.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"558f176e63687263a20002a2","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/558f155163687245320006c5#post_558f155163687245320006c5\r\nSo Zootopia will convince people that furries are cool?\r\n\r\nAnd the FNaF movie(s) as well?","author":"536f7a11636872666e2d0000"},{"id":"558f1790636872410e0004e0","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/558f155163687245320006c5#post_558f155163687245320006c5\r\n\r\n\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/558f15db6368725b2a0000c2#post_558f15db6368725b2a0000c2\r\nCat Tits when?\r\n\r\n\r\n\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/558f166863687241c90002a6#post_558f166863687241c90002a6\r\nOh god I gotta fined a video of those! \r\n\r\nI saw some video's of Vinny playing some Mario rom hacks.
