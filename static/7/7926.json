It's like faster than light travel; even though science fiction likes talking about these tropes a lot as far as we know so far it's impossible.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reasons why both of these aren't possible as far as we can tell so far is that creating portals or such to a different time or place runs the risk of creating a exotic particles; exotic particles run the risk in large quantities of pretty much metaphorically you're fucked.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"55b2edce6368724eb000074d","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55b2ecad636872773800013a#post_55b2ecad636872773800013a\r\n\r\n_Au contraire_. Faster than light travel is possible in theory. Particles with mass can never reach the speed of light, +however+, there's no law that space itself cannot exceed c, so instead of trying to accelerate the object past the speed of light, you move space itself around the object, mathematically this requires a negative energy density, which in turn requires the generation of lots and lots of exotic matter with negative mass, but this would mean you go from \"You'll need Universal levels of energy\", to \"Jupiter size levels of energy\".","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"55b2ee6d636872772e00035a","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"forward time travel is possible, look up time dilation ","author":"37e5b9d66361642500af5e00"},{"id":"55b2ef0d636872571c000fae","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Kaz\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55b2ee6d636872772e00035a#post_55b2ee6d636872772e00035a\r\n\r\nYou need to be close to a black hole for that to happen.
