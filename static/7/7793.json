For example, in the first case I did, the victim's body had crushed glasses under it. The witness to the crime mentioned how much he loved _glasses_, even though he wasn't currently wearing any (apparently, he \"lost\" them). Kind of easy. And at the end of the case, yes, that ended up being the deciding evidence. But you have to decide when the right time to bring that up is, otherwise the judge penalizes you. \r\n\r\nThat's kind of simple, though. Sometimes you have to press witnesses and then drop your questions in the right order for anything to happen. Knowing when to drop or when to continue questioning can be bit of an issue.\r\n\r\n\"@ice1517\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55ad1e7e6368725dcb001127#post_55ad1e7e6368725dcb001127\r\n\r\n\"@Virgil Stormblade\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55ad1e896368720229000f8c#post_55ad1e896368720229000f8c\r\n\r\nI'm thinking about it.
