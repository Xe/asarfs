It's different from terraforming.  Basically what they want to do is that it's not realistic to terraform the entire moon given our current capabilities, but rather what they are thinking of doing is creating a dome that people live in by using a smaller crater to form half it.\r\n\r\nBasically less like scifi and more like:\r\n!http://files.archinect.com/uploads/ai/aiu_chester_zoo_biodome_01x.jpg!\r\n\r\nThat would actually be a pretty good idea, because you could carry out local long term experiments on how to make the moon habitable as a whole.  If the moon ever does become habitable keep in mind we're not talking breathable atmosphere but rather cities in biodomes.\r\n\r\nIt could be how we get started on colonizing the solar system, scientific labs on the planets and moons dedicated to long term terraforming rather than getting all the shit there from earth.\r\n\r\nIf you're having a hard time envisioning what I mean:\r\n!http://www.nss.org/settlement/moon/LunarColonyRawlings650.jpg!\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso apparently carbon emissions from cars will be cut by 90% by 2030 due to driverless cars and hybrid vehicles.[/bq]\r\nSo basically what Cowboy Bebop did with Mars\r\n!http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/cowboybebop/images/0/0c/2_Marscity.png/revision/latest?cb=20090805152549!","author":"9ba2e84e636164642cc03200"},{"id":"55a192066368726606000c2b","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@EHAN\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55a1917063687251860003aa#post_55a1917063687251860003aa\r\nPretty much; terraforming a entire planet would take at least 500 years conservative estimate wise; transforming sections would be doable in one lifetime.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"55a1924e6368726606000c9c","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://40.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m87ideXEcf1r5giyqo1_500.png!","author":"9ba2e84e636164642cc03200"},{"id":"55a1946b6368723a59000803","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@EHAN\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55a1924e6368726606000c9c#post_55a1924e6368726606000c9c\r\n\r\nKnow the difference, it could save your life.","author":"5041b54f7f123b77af00a442"},{"id":"55a1947a6368726cc10001cd","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55a18b536368725567001221#post_55a18b536368725567001221\r\nEven with all side games, there sure as hell aren't that many Persona games.
