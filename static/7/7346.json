When Dio uses his Stand he just makes time to stop, doesn't make it go fowards or backwards it just5 stands still and he's capable of moving between that moment. When Dio punches someone he does it by coming in directing contact with the skin of the target, ergo, he doesn't use magic or the like to touch someone and the injuries they suffer appear once the effect is over as if they had been inflicted instantaneously.\r\n\r\nKenshiro's ability to remain intangible means no physical harm can get to him by direct means, aka punching him. So while he can be stopped in place, unless Dio goes the extra mile, he still won't be able to harm Kenshiro if he can't bypass the lack of physical mass.","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"559b584e636872699200230f","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/559b5769636872552c000bf0#post_559b5769636872552c000bf0\r\ni figure if you'd like a guy that much you'd get him on an im thing, iunno\r\n\r\nthis is the first time i've heard in a while that someone that primarily uses threads to talk is saying that they'd miss a specific person out of the thread rather than miss the whole thread\r\n\r\n\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/559b577d6368721b4f003346#post_559b577d6368721b4f003346\r\nsure; public spaces aren't exactly the best bonding places","author":"50a843d47f123b2e7c001359"},{"id":"559b58c5636872045f000ab2","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@hype\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/559b584e636872699200230f#post_559b584e636872699200230f\r\nI'm a weird guy, what can I say\r\n\r\n\r\n\"@QuasarNova\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/559b583463687225d9000839#post_559b583463687225d9000839\r\nI just mean, is a physical attack from Dio's hand, the same as a physical attack from Za Warudo's hand?
