If I have all my stuff in one partition there goes everything and running file recovery on such a large system is a pain in the fucking ass to do.  What's better to do is to have several partitions and have different stuff on them so in case I accidentally delete a file it doesn't take so fucking long to recover them.  If I accidentally delete my school work I can just click, click, click and recover them in a couple minutes; on the other hand if I had everything on the same partition that would take fucking ages to recover.  If you have to recover a terabyte hard drive you're going to be there all night; if you just recover a 50gb partition that'll take like twenty minutes.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53c0f92d6368725d06d20400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"you know, all this talk about tulpa, i decided to investigate about it more,it turns out it was a common buddist practice, hell this shit sounds so interesting im thinking of doing it as an experiment or something\r\n\r\n*\"this process took me a total of 130 hours: over the course of 2.5 months, 2-3 hours a day 5 days a week\"*\r\n\r\nyeah fuck that i still got enough videogames to kill time.","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"53c0fbed6368725d4bb60500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Started playing dark souls like 7 hours ago. \r\nI don't know what happened, all I remember was guds being gitted","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"}]}
