It's basically the same argument for pirating video games. It's not actually theft, since the \"stolen\" thing is still there, which clashes with the meaning of \"theft\". Of course, just because it's not technically theft doesn't make it automatically right. And to their credit, that's not what DA actually claims.\r\n\r\nHowever, this isn't even the actual issue here. For the most part, this article is actually pretty okay and I can agree with large parts of it. One could argue that they talk too much about things that don't matter very much (like the definition of \"art theft\"), but nothing's really bad.\r\n\r\nExcept for one single thing. And that _is_ the actual issue.\r\n\r\nThey talk quite a bit about what you can do to protect yourself. Good idea. Like, how you can add a watermark, lowering the resolution, contacting the DA staff to report...\r\n\r\nOh wait. That one's missing.\r\n\r\nYeah, they talk quite a bit about how you can protect yourself from art theft (or whatever they call it) and what you can do when it happens. But no word on how DA itself can help you and I doubt that they just forgot that part.\r\n\r\nBottom line: Someone took your art on DA? Tough shit, you're completely on your own.","author":"5179b098a4c72d9b7f0028ee"},{"id":"55aadd6c6368722e9000118c","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!https://40.media.tumblr.com/5194b245f817462c9eb78c759abacfc2/tumblr_mtaupm2GJW1razkaao1_500.png!","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"55aaddb563687248c4000851","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55aadd6c6368722e9000118c#post_55aadd6c6368722e9000118c\r\n;D","author":"37e5b9d66361642500af5e00"},{"id":"55aadeb26368722c16000536","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"The playstation TV is smaller than a vita game case\r\n\r\nThat's nuts ","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"55aadec36368722e90001423","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55aadd6c6368722e9000118c#post_55aadd6c6368722e9000118c\r\nThat's one way of putting it.","author":"4fdef063945b700a9d01604f"},{"id":"55aaded96368722fe6000f4c","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55aadeb26368722c16000536#post_55aadeb26368722c16000536\r\nYou got yourself a Playstation TV?
