And for SOME reason it came to my Step-Dads mind that instead of telling his kid to stop he instead said \"Ok than no one can play any games\".\r\n\r\nSo for a whole week I'm stuck dealing with your hyper active son and put up with him.\r\n\r\nWhile being punished for wanting my own space. Because I'm a kid so obviously that means I have to deal with him with no say in the matter.\r\n\r\nAlso while you, the Dad, not pay attention to him at all and instead sit around getting Drunk.\r\n\r\nThe kid would even sneak inside my room and when I tried to kick him out he'd run away and even kick me. He even at one point was *Butt Naked* running around in my room knocking over my shit and when I kicked him out and went to close the door he would try and _force his way through my door trying to get back inside_.\r\n\r\nThe Girl, Lets just say she was so bad that on several occasions my Mom noticed that she stole nearly half of her jewelry. \r\n\r\nAnd does my Step-Dad do anything about it? Nope. \r\n\r\nSo basically what I'm getting at is, My Step-Dad decides he's going to let his kids stay over for a week or 2.\r\n\r\nAnd instead of looking after his kids.\r\n\r\nLets instead push them onto your Wife and her Kids and than leave to do something else, and get drunk. And basically tell them to stop bothering you even though they are your responsibility. \r\n\r\nAt least though the Boy got a lot better as time wen by. He stopped being overly hyper. \r\n\r\nI mean he still was hyper but he matured a lot.\r\n\r\nAnd he did things on his own more. Even realized he should instead bring his own games.\r\n\r\nThough at the time I didn't mind him playing my games. good kid. \r\n\r\nHeard he wants to get into wrestling. You know the kind where you try and knock the opponent out of the arena?

Yeah, the kid's being a little shit, but it's because of the parent. In some way, it's not even the kid's fault because they haven't been taught how to act.\r\n\r\nMy best friend's little brother used to try and bust into her room when I was over. Now he doesn't because he won't leave his room for a second because he loves playing video games too much. He literally texts his mom to bring food to him, even if she's in the next room. It's sad, really, but what did the parents expect? They'd constantly buy him shit quite literally every day that fed into his addiction.
