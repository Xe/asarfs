If you were to with a laser compress all that energy into a extremely small time frame the amount of damage it would do would be far more.  If say you were to take a AAA battery and output all of that energy as light in a microsecond into one incredibly small area it would blow a person in half.\r\n\r\nTl:dr; We don't have star trek phazers or such cause it would require superconductors and thus not be worth it financially for large scale production.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"559c79a06368724b5200008a","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Carcass Strife\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/559c79766368721a000016f0#post_559c79766368721a000016f0\r\n\r\nHave fun.","author":"5041b54f7f123b77af00a442"},{"id":"559c79a26368724b5200008b","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/559c796b63687242de001587#post_559c796b63687242de001587\r\nThe creepiness was endearing","author":"4fdef063945b700a9d01604f"},{"id":"559c79ce6368726689000860","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/559c796b63687242de001587#post_559c796b63687242de001587\r\nNah, can't be, that adorable little kid was voiced by Yuri Lowenthal.
