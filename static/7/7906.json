The reason being is that western furries is a niche fandom whereas in the east and a lot of other countries furry is a niche of anime.  The reason why even though furry art is popular but the furry fandom isn't is because the furry niche of anime is popular whereas the furry fandom is a subculture.\r\n\r\n\r\nTl:dr; the reason why furry art is popular even though the furry fandom isn't popular is that in most parts of the world furry is just another niche of anime.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"55b1c926636872685d00021a","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55b1c8f76368727878000142#post_55b1c8f76368727878000142\r\nah ","author":"37e5b9d66361642500af5e00"},{"id":"55b1c94d636872525d0022ba","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55b1c8f76368727878000142#post_55b1c8f76368727878000142\r\nI've seen what could be considered furry porn under the \"Kemono\" tag on Pixiv.","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"55b1c99f6368727a6f0005ad","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55b1c94d636872525d0022ba#post_55b1c94d636872525d0022ba\r\nI know, but it's not a active subculture like it is in the west.

The reason being is that before the phase of a fandom/niche becoming super popular in general the populace's opinions of the thing tend to change for the most part and that they start receiving funding from larger companies, granted I'm not talking about fandoms that are already backed by a singular company but fandoms that already existed pushing for more funding into it.\r\n\r\nTo put it another way whenever a large company puts large funding into a already existing fandom they pump money into it and spread word of it to promote it.  In this case IMVU, while I agree IMVU is shitty it is a large company and thus is promoting the furry fandom.  While the idea of IMVU becoming furry IMVU is hilarious it does illustrate a point; fandoms that are artificially promoted are done so by companies funding them.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe other thing is that lately stuff featuring anthropomorphism has become popular again and that other fandoms that are chill with them are okay with them hanging out.\r\n\r\n\r\nTl:dr; large companies are pumping money into the furry fandom now and promoting it's growth and the general populace is starting to get interested in anthropomorphism again.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo further simplify it the furry fandom because so much money is getting pumped into it's starting to show long term systematic sustainable growth and while I'm not saying it's going to go mainstream in a year or so it probably will become popular sometime in the next ten.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"55b1cc41636872795f000386","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55b1cbf56368727a6f000907#post_55b1cbf56368727a6f000907\r\nHey if it brings back Swat Kats then I'M FOR IT.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"55b1cd036368727eb7000032","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"To put this in perspective when furaffinity first started off ten years ago it only had 12k active users; a year ago it broke 1 million active users.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"55b1cd8763687271ae00013b","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I'm not sure if I'd even consider myself a furry, Considering that I'm not that interested in Anthro stuff.","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"55b1cd9e636872793d00056a","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55b1cd036368727eb7000032#post_55b1cd036368727eb7000032\r\nAre Bronies part of the bunch?","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"55b1cdc8636872703300070d","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"YOOOOOOO!\r\nSWAT KATS KICKSTARTER IS ALREADY HALFWAY AT IT'S GOAL!","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"55b1cddc636872795f000556","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"What is Swat kats?","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"55b1ce1f63687271ae0001dd","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@QuasarNova\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55b1cddc636872795f000556#post_55b1cddc636872795f000556\r\nSwat Kats was the raddest cartoon of the early 90s.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"55b1ce4d63687271ae000212","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SeraphimDawn\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55b1cd9e636872793d00056a#post_55b1cd9e636872793d00056a\r\nit's like a cousin sub genre in a way","author":"37e5b9d66361642500af5e00"}]}
