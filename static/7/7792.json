Good to hear the Boy matured. Looking back I'm pretty glad I matured as soon as I did. (ended up being most mature person in my year/grade, despite always being the youngest.) As for the wrestling bit, I think that might be Lucha Libre or Sumo, one of the two. That's a cool career path.","author":"4fde01d7945b70057c00024d"},{"id":"55ad168d6368725dcb000744","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Are we sharing kid stories?

I was there every day, all of the librarians knew me, and after a ~ certain incident ~ which I believe I've shared here a while back, all of them were looking out for me.\r\n\r\nMy library did this thing called \"tweens night out\". Instead of sitting at home, kids could come to our YA section and chill out. And of course, the kids that tended to go to those types of things were mild. I mean, chess of all of the things was a popular game at this event; that's how quiet they usually were. And this night, it seemed like the same would happen. \r\n\r\nThen, they came.\r\n\r\nI had just finished telling a new volunteer everything I mentioned before; the kids were probably going to be easy to supervise. He seemed nervous, but was assuaged by what I had said. When the twins first approached me to sign in, they seemed okay enough. Sixth grade, kind of rowdy but normal enough for their age. Thirty minutes in, one of them seems to be intrigued with the volunteers, and we're talking to him. The other comes up to us and *screams* in our ears. I mean, *screams*. My heat is pounding painfully, which is why I don't really like being scared, and I tell him politely to stop. Nope. He does it to different kids all around the room. So now I'm looking at the other volunteers, who are lined up directly behind me (this is important). One of the twins knocks very hard into me and laughs, and we all go down like dominoes. The nervous volunteer from before is hurt so badly from the weight that his has trouble getting up. He meets his twin on the wheelchair ramp and starts screaming that he's going to fight him. It's mayhem, they're wrestling and cussing as loudly as they can.\r\n\r\nBut I finally think I have a break when I see their father approach them. I tell him as politely as I can all that has happened. He mumbles something at the boys, and they ignore him.I go to check the injured volunteer, and when I turn around? The father is _gone._  ","author":"5041b54f7f123b77af00a442"},{"id":"55ad19986368725dcb000b21","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@And Brother I Hurt People\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55ad190d6368724e57000e3a#post_55ad190d6368724e57000e3a\r\nWhat \"certain\" incident?\r\n\r\n\"@Number1pegasus\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55ad190a6368724e57000e33#post_55ad190a6368724e57000e33\r\nAbout the cena thing?","author":"55ac02c163687266f50004f1"},{"id":"55ad1a176368726106000393","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Number1pegasus\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55ad190a6368724e57000e33#post_55ad190a6368724e57000e33\r\nBritains usually got pretty gloomy weather, we aren't completly used to good weather.\r\n\r\n\"@And Brother I Hurt People\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55ad190d6368724e57000e3a#post_55ad190d6368724e57000e3a\r\nOH MY GOD!
