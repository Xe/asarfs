us all remember the true meaning behind this holiday, and that is to have a sense of smug superiority to literally everyone else on the planet.\r\n\r\nToday is a day for judging others, whether it be for lacking patriotism and enthusiasm, or for having patriotism and enthusiasm. Today is a day to look down on your fellow humans for any number of reasons.\r\n\r\nWhy, you don't even have to be American to join in the fun! Just point out how we're all fat, violent idiots all day while bitching about any mention of American culture! And of course we can't forget the smug cultural posturing! Today is an excellent day to increase your own ego and sense of moral superiority by pointing out every flaw, sin, and inequality in others who do not share your own political sensibilities, or even in the country as a whole!\r\n\r\nAlso some crap about the founding of the country or something, I don't know. I've gotta march in a parade in 12 hours with a couple other guys from my VFW, and we really don't have time to worry about that shit while silently judging everyone we pass.","author":"4f41ee04945b701c41002af7"},{"id":"559760376368727e410003fc","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@gasmaskangel\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55975ff76368724cd40013bf#post_55975ff76368724cd40013bf\r\n*FUCKIN' AMEN BROTHER!*","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"559760986368727e41000494","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"amen indeed, the blissful arrogance is really the icing on the cake with this holiday","author":"50a843d47f123b2e7c001359"},{"id":"5597618e63687204aa00044e","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Alright then","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"5597627d63687224b2000f75","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I just noticed the logo is in red white and blue....\r\n\r\n","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"5597628263687233dc0000b3","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I just noticed the logo is in red white and blue....\r\n\r\n","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"}]}
