Back in the day what she did was when great grandma died grandma went on a drug spree and wound up so fucked up in the head that she can't function anymore before great grandma was even buried yet then got arrested and put into 24/7 supervised nursing home cause went grand theft auto shot up a bunch of drugs and smashed into someone's car.\r\n\r\nToday I found out that my uncle is continuing to cash out money for himself even though he's not taking care of grandma.  He's spending her money and shit on kayaking and such.  He has no job nor has he ever attempted to find a job cause if he finds a job that means he can't write off spending grandma's money as \"reimbursement\".\r\n\r\nFurthermore even though he's burning through fucking all the money he ain't giving my mom next to none of it even though she's on the living will.\r\n\r\nDon't even get me started on my siblings; more than likely there won't be any money left by the time grandma dies so arguing about this shit is pointless.  Hell grandma ain't even dead yet nor is she probably going to die soon cause she probably has a good decade left on her life.\r\n\r\n\r\nI know my life sucks and that, but my god at least I try to contribute; I only use up about $200 a month and I give a thousand every five months, but the fact that everyone talks about me as though I'm some sort of parasite drives me up the fucking wall when they're the ones trying to get a hold of other people's money while said person is still alive.\r\n\r\n\r\nTl:dr; drug addict grandma in secure nursing home; siblings want her money, uncle wants her money and is spending all her fucking money absurdly fast; they don't give a fuck about anyone but themselves money wise.\r\n\r\nTl:dr of Tl:dr; grandma ain't even dead yet and everyone's trying to take her money.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"55ac3d8f63687202ff0004cd","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@MoogSourceVermona\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55ac36146368720ab50000a3#post_55ac36146368720ab50000a3\r\n\r\nI'm intrigued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"@Dashu\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55ac3c78636872098400097e#post_55ac3c78636872098400097e\r\n\r\nAww, you don't want to see them [spoiler]rip out Mai's fetus, rape it, and then throw it in a blender and force her to drink it?[/spoiler]","author":"5041b54f7f123b77af00a442"},{"id":"55ac3dee6368727f44000673","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55ac3d7b636872087800046e#post_55ac3d7b636872087800046e\r\nWow.
