For instance, in Naruto, there seems to be this obsession with redeemable villains. It's not a bad idea, except that they kinda sweep the villain's actions under the rug. Damn near every villain is fucking redeemable. Say what you want about Dragon Ball, but at least they treated the villains there like actual villains.","author":"554d477e63687270dee30600"},{"id":"559db5c06368724afc000936","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/559db46263687254d00005e5#post_559db46263687254d00005e5\r\nFor fighting someone new every two episodes or so, part 3 has a pretty unclear kill count.
