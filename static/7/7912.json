Yeah, no; the bill wouldn't do jack shit to help the working class, if anything it would fuck things up for the working class.\r\n\r\nIf someone here supports the TPP cause \"It's a progressive bill\" you're literally fucking retarded cause the bill would promote fracking and under it you wouldn't know what goes into your food, etc.\r\n\r\nThe TPP is SOPA 2.0 on crack.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"55b23eed6368723cf200159d","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I'd never thought I'd see the day my friend would call me a tsundere.","author":"4fdef063945b700a9d01604f"},{"id":"55b240676368723cf20017ca","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"i will never see the day a friend calls me tsundere","author":"50a843d47f123b2e7c001359"},{"id":"55b2429e6368724841003e75","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55b23c826368723cf2001196#post_55b23c826368723cf2001196\r\nIn my experience most things designed to \"help the working class\" fail because they wind up financially supported exclusively by the working class.
