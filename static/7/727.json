It wouldn't be so bad if the monster didn't have his head bobbing around like a paddle ball beating the crap out of the ball.  What's worse is that they throw twenty at you.  That means you have to 600 headshots in the course of five minutes.\r\n\r\nOn the plus side I've gotten so good at headshots in games thanks to this bullcrap that I could probably shoot a apple off on top of Michael J Fox's head after you give him a triple espresso without hitting him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPolitical new:\r\nRepublicans and libertarians may want to close their ears cause it's going to make them run out the door screaming:\r\nSo apparently republicans future presidential electability is so shot to hell that even mainstream 24/7 news is now reporting on how low their chances are maintaining coherent as a party and not being forced to dissolve.  What I mean by this is essentially: Damn the republican party's chances of maintaining electability post 2016 are so low at this point that even the news is starting to question if they're going to be able to be electable in the future and starting to question where conservatives should go from here.\r\n\r\nTo make it short: If you're republican or libertarian 2015 is going to be a extremely painful year for you politically and 2016 is going to be year of the \"OH FUCK! We dun fucked up!\".","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53b7e7996368723472dd0500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53b7e22a6368723334e00300#post_53b7e22a6368723334e00300\r\nI'm not savvy with American politics (only Scottish and English) but didn't the republicans have binders full of women?","author":"515ddf93a4c72d8a1f000d57"},{"id":"53b7e97663687234276e0600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@ThatRandomGuy42\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53b7e7996368723472dd0500#post_53b7e7996368723472dd0500\r\nThat was a dumb sentence Romney said without thinking before he said it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make it extremely short for non-americans or people that don't keep up with politics the usa doesn't have a direct vote; we have \"electoral votes\" where each state has a set amount of votes that represent the population.  Bigger states get bigger number of votes.  In order to become president you have to win 270 electoral votes; popular vote doesn't matter.  Hell Bush didn't even win the popular vote the second time so technically speaking we didn't vote for Bush to get his second term.\r\n\r\nAnyways republicans, the party that's against birth control, gay rights, immigration and so forth dun fucked up bad.  Simply put they can no longer get elected president even in optimal scenarios.\r\n\r\nThe democrats on the other hand will automatically have 246 electoral votes in the bag; the best republicans can hope for is only 200 electoral votes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTl:dr; The conservative party, aka the republican party, aka Bush's party in the usa dun fucked up and nuked themselves.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53b7e9f46368725257b80000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53b7e97663687234276e0600#post_53b7e97663687234276e0600\r\nThat's a good thing, right?\r\nI don't really have solid opinions on birth control or immigration, but if they are against gay rights, I hope they never get in.","author":"515ddf93a4c72d8a1f000d57"},{"id":"53b7ece563687220d94f0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@ThatRandomGuy42\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53b7e9f46368725257b80000#post_53b7e9f46368725257b80000\r\nProbably what's going to happen is a new \"Era of good feeling\".  The era of good feeling was a period in the usa in which the whig party(a now dead political party) died and for about a decade the party in power was uncontested.\r\n\r\nBasically you know how you guys in europe make fun of us for being so bassackwards and not having things like universal healthcare or such?  Well we very well could swing hard towards such beliefs cause the party who opposes universal healthcare, gay rights, immigration, lesser prison sentences, gun control, increase in spending on stuff like education and so forth is about to collapse hard in two years cause they dun fucked up.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53b7eea66368723452450700","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I have given up on the Internet. \r\nDue to my most important examination in a month's time, I have to devote every second of my time studying for it. \r\nThat means no games, no TV, no phone and most importantly, no Internet. \r\n\r\nThis isn't the first time I did this. \r\nIn fact, 2 years ago I did the same thing.
