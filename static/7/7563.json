The reason why he doesn't interfere is because of time.\r\n\r\nWhen you get down to it a outside interfering with a universe is *BEYOND* unethical because time isn't a direction or a motion; rather it's frozen.  The best analogy for what time is a frozen river.  From the inside perspective we think that it is moving when in reality it's frozen solid.  From a inside perspective things are moving.  From a outside observer's perspective the universe is a giant particle with 10^81 particles in it that flashed and died.  From a inside perspective things are happening.  From a outside perspective everything has having happening happened already, not yet and is happening.\r\n\r\nEvery time a outside observer changes something from happening they in turn change a event that has already happened already.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo put it in a much simpler context congratulations you killed hitler, on the other hand you've also killed all the people that were born during the baby boomer generation that wouldn't have been born if not for WWII by preventing them from ever being born and in turn killed all their children and killed all their grandchildren.\r\n\r\nSince we're experiencing the universe it's ethical for us to change our fate, but for outside observers it's not ethical because they already know everything that is to happen so they can see all the people that would get wiped from reality if they interfere.\r\n\r\nTo put it another way the most likely reason why haven't seen any time travelers is because every time you save one person you kill hundreds others in the future.  The only time it would be ethical for outside observers to change past events would be in events that are endangering the whole universe.\r\n\r\n\r\nTl:dr; the universe is like a book; sure you may feel as though things are happening when you read it, but the second it's printed everything it is already having happened.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"55a32a196368726775000dda","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Carcass Strife\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55a329da6368726775000d73#post_55a329da6368726775000d73\r\n!https://cdn1.designbyhumans.com/product/design/u227409/pr72896-2-1219424-600x600-b-p-313131.jpg!","author":"500757fd7f123b75a90003b1"},{"id":"55a32a706368726775000e6b","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Things are looking fine for now.
