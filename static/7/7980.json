I don't watch the news any more because it causes me... it hurts me. It hurts me deeply. Especially during election season.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, it is too early to make these calls I think. Yes a lot of people have Trump on the brain now because the fuck stain has no filter between his brain and his mouth, but I don't rate his actual chances once debates and shit get started because the guy's a fucking moron. He'll embarrass himself in the debates and then we'll have a republican nominee that doesn't cause me to hate vomit blood.\r\n\r\nPlease, I need to believe this.
