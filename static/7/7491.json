Same principle with pearls harvested from farms versus pearls gathered from the deep. The latter being pricier even thoguh they're technically the same. I'd wager we'd see labels like \"100% real human voice\" or something fetching a finer price.","author":"52f0834d63687261cba90300"},{"id":"55a0c0e063687228fa000f4b","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"robots cant sing like this though\":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGR4KVCzjpw\r\n\r\nnor are able to capture the emotion and ideology behind it\r\n\r\nmaybe robots will prevail in pop and other stale lifeless genres, but us hipsters will stick to our emotional supremacy","author":"50a843d47f123b2e7c001359"},{"id":"55a0c0f963687228fa000f6c","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Albus Fahrenheits\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55a0c08063687266a9003027#post_55a0c08063687266a9003027\r\nSong now with 100% more human now available!","author":"4fdef063945b700a9d01604f"},{"id":"55a0c18363687266a90031f3","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Albus Fahrenheits\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55a0c08063687266a9003027#post_55a0c08063687266a9003027\r\nThat's actually a fair guess.  If they do perfect making programs that sing better than humans there will still be a industry for human singers, just not as much. . . but considering the shit pile that the music industry has putting out lately it's not that bad of a future.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first \"singers\" that will probably be replaced will be people like Snooki or Nicki.
