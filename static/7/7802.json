Most people that level of crazy do not care about getting better, nor do they want to nor do they have the strength to.\r\n\r\nI know you're a good person, but not everyone who has that level of mental problems wants to get better.  It's really hard to overcome severe mental problems and from what you've told us she doesn't give a fuck about wanting to work it out so if you do try you're just going to get worn out from trying and eventually you're going to get frustrated and it will fuck up your life trying.\r\n\r\nIt sounds like a dick thing, but I've been there mentally and very rarely do people legitimately attempt or desire to work on their problems; not everyone wants to be metaphorically saved and not everyone wants to work it out; a fuck ton of people just when they get to that level just want to give up and they do give up and no matter how much you try to get them to care they don't care and just give up.\r\n\r\nTo put it another way for every person that gets through severe life crippling mental problems there's 9 others that just give up.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt sounds like a dick thing to say, but trust me if someone's like how you're describing then better that a psychologist tries than she screw up your life.  Just walk out the door and go \"fuck it\".","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"55ad5334636872636500052c","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55ad52a56368724a0a00074c#post_55ad52a56368724a0a00074c\r\n-I didn't leave them \r\nI watched them even when I was angry\r\nI watch them all the time\r\nAnd as a friend I just want to say shut the fuck up right now....\r\nBut thank you- \r\n\r\nUgh \r\nI'm just so tired\r\nAnd yeah I know all that\r\n\r\nBut I can't leave them alone \r\nSo I was stuck with them ","author":"51a2815b7f123be59500049b"},{"id":"55ad545e6368725dde000246","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55ad52a56368724a0a00074c#post_55ad52a56368724a0a00074c\r\nI'll\r\nHave to reread that post later \r\nI'm just so blah right now that I can't think straight ","author":"51a2815b7f123be59500049b"},{"id":"55ad55b9636872283f000e1a","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SidewardManatee\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55ad5334636872636500052c#post_55ad5334636872636500052c\r\nI know man; dealing with this kind of shit is hard.\r\n\r\nFor now go somewhere else, watch a movie. . well clean up your face first cause it sounds like they fucked you up. . just stay away from them as long as you can.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"55ad56ae6368725453000a78","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55ad55b9636872283f000e1a#post_55ad55b9636872283f000e1a\r\nYa\r\nI currently laying in bed in front of a fan, probably will fall asleep \r\n","author":"51a2815b7f123be59500049b"},{"id":"55ad56fd6368725dde000493","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55ad3f0d63687278830014ad#post_55ad3f0d63687278830014ad\r\n[bq=\"Too_Offensive\"]WHY DID I WATCH THE SECOND PART OF THE GAMEGRUMPS PLAYING SONIC ADVENTURE\r\n\r\nITS JUST GOING TO KEEP MAKING ME ANGRY[/bq]\r\nI've heard about that, and how bad it is so far\r\n\r\nThey died on Chaos _ZERO_\r\n\r\nAnd they got a game over on _*EMERALD COAST*_","author":"9ba2e84e636164642cc03200"},{"id":"55ad5849636872283f001249","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SidewardManatee\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55ad52876368725447000635#post_55ad52876368725447000635\r\nWell...\r\nYou know you have to do 10 things to get an emblem, right?\r\nA very special one at that.","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"55ad59066368725447000ee8","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@EHAN\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55ad56fd6368725dde000493#post_55ad56fd6368725dde000493\r\nArin doesn't shut up about how \"shit\" the game is, simultaniously starting a shitstorm in the comments.","author":"4fde426c945b700a970029ac"},{"id":"55ad599e6368722c27001379","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@EHAN\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55ad56fd6368725dde000493#post_55ad56fd6368725dde000493\r\nThis is why I stopped watching game grumps personally, I can't handle that level of failure in a game.
