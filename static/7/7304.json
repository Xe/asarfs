This happens when a language in the course of its normal development gradually morphs into something that is then recognized as a separate, different language, leaving the old form with no native speakers. Thus, for example, Old English may be regarded as a \"dead language\", with no native speakers, although it has never \"died\" but instead simply changed and developed into Middle English, Early Modern English and Modern English. The process of language change may also involve the splitting up of a language into a family of several daughter languages, leaving the common parent language \"dead\". This has happened to Latin, which (through Vulgar Latin) eventually developed into the Romance languages, and Prakrit which developed into the Hindustani language and its dialects. Such a process is normally not described as \"language death\", because it involves an unbroken chain of normal transmission of the language from one generation to the next, with only minute changes at every single point in the chain. Thus with regard to Latin, for example, there is no point at which Latin \"died\"; it evolved in different ways in different geographic areas, and its modern forms are now identified by a plethora of different names such as French, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, Romanian, Catalan, Galician, Venetian, etc.\r\n\r\n ","author":"509f70a87f123b77eb0004fd"},{"id":"55995c32636872235b001491","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Virgil Stormblade\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5599494963687212ce000259#post_5599494963687212ce000259\r\n[bq=\"Virgil Stormblade\"]Latin's a dead language?
