Hydroponic vertical farms are healthier than anything we have on market because it can be grown in the city where people buy it, they don't need any pesticides, herbicides or fertilizers because they're in a environment where the chances of them being exposed to pests or that is marginal; also the amount of fuel to transport them is marginal compared to other forms of crop production, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo put it another way the world produces enough food to feed everyone; rather the problem is the people that go hungry can't afford to eat because the amount of money to eat a sustainable diet they can't afford because most of the time the crops that are grown in their local area are outside their income level because demand is too high for them thus increasing the costs.  Hydroponic vertical farms opens up the opportunity of drastically reducing the global hunger rate because any crop could be grown anywhere in the world locally thus drastically reducing prices.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso the drastic reduction in the destruction of woodland, the drastic reduction in carbon emission transporting food.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"55b547406368723f990013cd","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55b5454c636872236000071e#post_55b5454c636872236000071e\r\nSpeaking of hydroponics.
