The reason why brute forcing security passwords is that if your target is a high level target that's a fast ass way to wind up with the police banging on your front door.\r\n\r\nAlso no actual black hat hacker goes around announcing it to the world either.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHonestly thinking on this kind of makes me want to get something to drink cause when I think about it the majority of security intrusions could be prevented if microsoft would just come out with a stable operating system and businesses let programmers do their job instead of constantly rushing their ass off.  Windows is about as secure as a sponge is waterproof so compound that with how a lot of businesses are run by CEO's that don't understand that allowing security holes to go unchecked means potentially millions of stolen dollars you have a recipe for disaster.\r\n\r\n\r\nSide note:\r\nNo I am not a hacker, what I do is totally different the only similarity is we both use C++ that's about as similar dentists and veterinarians.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53bdb4a26368723f5bac0300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/790/413/aeb.jpg!","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53bdc1b863687254ecef0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"The Tumblr-4Chan pics are pretty funny xD\r\n\r\n!http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/788/728/71e.png!\r\n\r\n!http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/789/271/914.gif!\r\n\r\n!http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/789/455/f48.gif!\r\n\r\n!http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/789/735/23f.gif!\r\n\r\n!http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/789/795/c69.gif!\r\n\r\n!http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/790/242/91c.gif!\r\n\r\n!http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/789/506/816.png!\r\n\r\n!http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/789/435/629.gif!\r\n","author":"31bee2686368722a0df23600"},{"id":"53bdc357636872538e340100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Gizoid101\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53bdc1b863687254ecef0000#post_53bdc1b863687254ecef0000\r\nSome of it is...just....\r\n!http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/788/637/9eb.png!\r\n!http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/789/633/3ba.png!\r\n!http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/789/757/91a.png!\r\n!http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/789/539/506.png!\r\n!http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/789/046/40d.png!\r\n!http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/790/073/674.png!\r\n\r\nHow sad is this fucking world where we fight wars with porn, gore and gifs?","author":"515ddf93a4c72d8a1f000d57"},{"id":"53bdc5656368725579e10100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@ThatRandomGuy42\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53bdc357636872538e340100#post_53bdc357636872538e340100\r\nIt's honestly kind of funny.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"53bdc6a763687253021e0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@ThatRandomGuy42\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53bdc357636872538e340100#post_53bdc357636872538e340100\r\n\r\nSuicides?\r\n...Really?","author":"31bee2686368722a0df23600"},{"id":"53bdc7d5636872567bc70200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"There is nothing tumblr can do to 4chan its users don't do to each other 1000 times over.","author":"4fe16df67f123b13e400003f"}]}
