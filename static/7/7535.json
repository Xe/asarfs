We were extraordinarily lucky; my school didn't have any cliques, you were free to go be a part of whatever group you so pleased. Because of this, my group was very diversified - me, the A+ student, our constantly drunk and/or stoned blonde party girl, the asian president of the theater crew group, the up-and-coming baritone (my boyfriend to this day, as you guys may know)...there was a lot of us. But one came uninvited - Elizabeth. \r\n\r\nLong story short, Elizabeth was \"in love\" (as much as you really can be in HS, at least) with my boyfriend. Whomever had the audacity to talk to him would be glared at. Normal, petty shit like that. But she also wanted to impress him by trying to sound \"intelligent\". So one day, when we called her black, she screamed at us and proclaimed loudly for the world to hear \"I am NOT black, I am Canadian\". Silence.\r\n\r\nElizabeth did a lot of weird shit like that. Can't believe I forgot about her.\r\n\r\n\"@PaskaNaakka\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55a2ae7963687225d4000df6#post_55a2ae7963687225d4000df6\r\n\r\nDoesn't China have a rep for kidnapping women from other nations because the female to male rate is so low?
