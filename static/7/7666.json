Argument over.\r\n\r\nJust wanted to say I kinda disagree with this statement. Because it assume that's the fans the movies have built will immediately leave after the movies end.\r\n\r\nThe fans that came from the movie probably won't just leave. They will probably stay for a bit. Comic sales sertianly won't be anything specular, but I highly doubt there will be a crash. Drop in sales yes. Massive crash? No. Probably just go back to number of sales it had pre movies.\r\n\r\nWhich...really isn't all that different from now.","author":"500757fd7f123b75a90003b1"},{"id":"55a867a463687221ed0002a6","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55a8668d636872361b000043#post_55a8668d636872361b000043\r\nLying on a bed in my friend's house for no reason at all.","author":"4fdef063945b700a9d01604f"},{"id":"55a867b063687221da00030b","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55a86681636872361b000037#post_55a86681636872361b000037\r\n[bq=\"SquiggyBomb\"]\"@Princess♠Molestia\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55a866406368725b24000df8#post_55a866406368725b24000df8\r\nJohnny Test needs to be burned alive and his screams of agony recorded so I can fall asleep to them every night.[/bq]\r\n@The recording will be filled with whip sounds?@","author":"31bee2686368722a0df23600"},{"id":"55a867b66368722d100001ef","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55a8675c6368723ccd0008ab#post_55a8675c6368723ccd0008ab\r\nIt only makes me indifferent to him more!!!!!","author":"500757fd7f123b75a90003b1"},{"id":"55a867e4636872225200029b","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Gizoid101\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55a866f26368722252000178#post_55a866f26368722252000178\r\n[bq=\"Gizoid101\"]@The only CN cartoon that I really enjoyed when I was young was Megas XLR@\r\n[/bq]\r\n!http://oi62.tinypic.com/fn5q8g.jpg!\r\n!http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v661/SephirothRyu/Comical/Megas/Missles.jpg!\r\n!http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v661/SephirothRyu/Comical/Megas/Betyoucantguesswhatthisbuttondoes.jpg!\r\n!http://40.media.tumblr.com/dfcfdd54a784fcae00764d7fb2cfe396/tumblr_mnupmmFYKX1so9972o4_1280.jpg!\r\n!http://41.media.tumblr.com/012ebf71633d47cf0a159035f45b38db/tumblr_mnupmmFYKX1so9972o2_1280.jpg!","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"55a8682f6368722252000308","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55a85dc163687266a5000712#post_55a85dc163687266a5000712\r\nuc9, thank you, for describing how utterly shit Teen Titans Go is.
