When it comes to intelligence for the most part once you reach a certain point it gets hard to talk to people in normal conversations and explain it in everyday terminology.\r\n\r\nIt's why popular scientists aren't all that good because for every Neil Degrasse Tyson there's someone behind him rolling his eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot to sound egotistical, but as a child they thought there was something wrong with me cause I couldn't speak well cause I could get answers to the questions easy and that but whenever I tried to talk I tried push all that information out all at once and it would sound like \"eyrupnoone\" cause your brain works so much faster than your mouth so while it doesn't sound like a problem, but if you try to shove out all of your thoughts at once it doesn't make sense when it leaves your mouth.\r\n\r\n\r\nDon't ever try to talk to savants, cause they're so intelligent that most of them don't know how to talk or communicate anymore.  To everyday people they seem \"stupid\", but if you can actually understand them you realize they're not actually \"stupid\" they're just so smart they don't know how to function.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5599b57f63687221d40000b5","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SidewardManatee\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5599b45f63687273bb0013a6#post_5599b45f63687273bb0013a6\r\n\"(0-0v)\":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24CPil1scVg","author":"509f70a87f123b77eb0004fd"},{"id":"5599b61e63687221d40001ad","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5599b4f863687273bb0014a7#post_5599b4f863687273bb0014a7\r\n\r\n\"@Whatevs\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5599b44b6368723f97001c6a#post_5599b44b6368723f97001c6a\r\n\r\nYou're just describing one aspect of intelligence there.\r\n\r\nIf you want to get pretty specific, intelligence is pretty much a chart with RPG skills.\r\n\r\nYou'll develop some areas both because it's easier, but also because the way our behavior is shaped due to external sources means that some skills will get sacrificed in favors of others, so someone who is great at calculus at the expense of social interaction is not necessarily smarter or dumber when compared to someone who is bad at math but has people skills honed to sell ice to a penguin.
