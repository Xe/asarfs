We could have a moon base of say five or so people, but right now since NASA's been getting shat on so hard by congress they can barely function with what little money they have.  The reason why this part pisses me off is that part of NASA's purpose is to map killer asteroids so if we all die cause of a asteroid or a city gets wiped off the face of the earth it's totally 100% congress' fault.\r\n\r\nThe other thing we don't have is fusion energy; the reason why we don't have that is a bunch of higher explanations into physics but essentially the fusion reactors we've had were massively inefficient.  The new reactors are taking a fuck ton of money to build cause the tokamak is how they've built them for decades.  Boeing is getting close though; they're getting all hush hush lately.  The new ones are way more complex; tokamak type reactors essentially used brute force to achieve fusion; the new ones are taking everything we learned from the tokamaks and making a optimal reactor based off that.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53b6f8076368722b9c240600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Princess♠Molestia\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53b6f6c96368727359b90400#post_53b6f6c96368727359b90400\r\n*Meanwhile seconds later*\r\n\r\nBay news 51: \"In other news a crazy Alien went on a rampage through out the city vaporizing innocent men and women\" \r\n\r\nLaid back Aliens: \"Jesus, what is the universe coming to?\"","author":"50c204917f123b31440000a5"},{"id":"53b6f85a6368722779610000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"For gun enthusiasts.\r\n\r\n!http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/Gyrogroup.jpg!\r\n1960s \"Gyrojet\":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyrojet\r\n\r\n!http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c321/Ash_403/dardick1.jpg!\r\n1950s\r\n\r\nCool, but epic fails.","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"}]}
