An actual beginning, middle and end of a story for The Sims 2. And I also played the PS2 version of it too, which is more like the PC version in that it doesn't have a story. And so far, the PSP version is the only one that has an actual story. BTW, the PSP version has a 3rd-person perspective whereas the PS2 version uses the more traditional overhead perspective.","author":"554d477e63687270dee30600"},{"id":"55a91f756368723836001c7b","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Virgil Stormblade\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55a91f4763687237e2002cd6#post_55a91f4763687237e2002cd6\r\n\r\n...isn't the entire point of the Sims to make your *own* story?","author":"5041b54f7f123b77af00a442"},{"id":"55a91f9463687237f1002804","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@And Brother I Hurt People\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55a91f1063687272cf00083c#post_55a91f1063687272cf00083c\r\n....\r\nI'm concerned about the parents.","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"55a91fda636872384a0017df","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Carcass Strife\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55a91ea263687272cf0007d3#post_55a91ea263687272cf0007d3\r\n*Uses the God hand*\r\n\r\n!http://www.godfist.com/godhandfan/images/gifs/pummel_loop_azel.gif!","author":"50c204917f123b31440000a5"},{"id":"55a91fe663687272cf0008fb","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@And Brother I Hurt People\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55a91f756368723836001c7b#post_55a91f756368723836001c7b\r\nWell, you can still do all the stuff that you can do in the other versions and the game doesn't force you to finish the story, unless you want to get some upgrades or new job opportunities.","author":"554d477e63687270dee30600"},{"id":"55a9200963687264ec000d89","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Carcass Strife\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55a91f9463687237f1002804#post_55a91f9463687237f1002804\r\n\r\nDon't.
