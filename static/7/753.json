I can see what grips people have with it, but stuff like not having the ability to sell your guns to just anyone when you think about it is primarily a way to prevent people from having too much money off the bat and prevent the player from just buying like a hundred medkits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyways and now for your daily news:\r\nI realized what is probably going to happen politically post 2016.  You know how I keep talking about how republicans shot themselves in the foot hard?  Well chances are the republican party will continue to exist, rather the religious right and tea party are going to get fucked hard; what is more than likely going to happen is that the republican party post 2016 will sort of resemble the libertarian party, but not the ayn rand type, rather the 420 blaze it sort.\r\n\r\nThe current factions in the republican base that are totally fucked are the mainstream tea party, the religious right, the anti-glbt movement faction, the anti-immigration faction, the big government faction, the warhawks are super fucked, the people who constantly suck big business ceo's huge loads of money and so forth.  The only group that would really be left is the libertarian-esque factions and isolationist factions.\r\n\r\nWhile I disagree with libertarians it would be nice for the anti-glbt movement and such to get nuked to oblivion.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53bb61f96368723e06b60000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@gasmaskangel\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53bb58af6368724481940100#post_53bb58af6368724481940100\r\n!http://filadaputa.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/kabuto.gif!","author":"513e68eda4c72d4e3b000164"},{"id":"53bb62ed63687265ecac0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53bb5ed46368721c5cb10000#post_53bb5ed46368721c5cb10000\r\nAs one of the 420 Blaze It style libertarians, this pleases me, however I do disagree with your prediction in some ways. The least popular fringes that for some insane reason the GOP panders to (the religious right, the super lunatic Tea Partiers and the anti-lgbt movement) are going to lose a lot of power, but I think they'll still have a finger hold on the party and its policies. It'll take a bit more time to remove that poison from the GOP.\r\n\r\nAnd while you might disagree with libertarians at least its possible for us to be civil since we don't blanketly oppose basic human rights.","author":"4f41ee04945b701c41002af7"},{"id":"53bb6309636872064a520000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Ore-O\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53bb61f96368723e06b60000#post_53bb61f96368723e06b60000\r\nYeah... not really a pokemon fan though I do recognize that as one.","author":"4f41ee04945b701c41002af7"},{"id":"53bb63576368723d6f0a0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@gasmaskangel\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53bb58af6368724481940100#post_53bb58af6368724481940100\r\n\r\n\"@Ore-O\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53bb61f96368723e06b60000#post_53bb61f96368723e06b60000\r\n!http://oi38.tinypic.com/ws0ldl.jpg!\r\nYou won't walk the path of heaven that's for sure","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"53bb641363687246ad000000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Ore-O\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53bb61f96368723e06b60000#post_53bb61f96368723e06b60000\r\nDOME!","author":"505696b47f123b37e800effa"},{"id":"53bb66fd6368723f49830000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53bb63576368723d6f0a0100#post_53bb63576368723d6f0a0100\r\nEh, I wasn't gonna go to heaven anyways.","author":"513e68eda4c72d4e3b000164"},{"id":"53bb68c56368721f7d280000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Ore-O\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53bb66fd6368723f49830000#post_53bb66fd6368723f49830000\r\nWhat if God kidnaps you?","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"53bb6923636872324b740100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SeraphimDawn\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53bb68c56368721f7d280000#post_53bb68c56368721f7d280000\r\n!http://37.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l7dqu5tdvP1qdodsno1_500.jpg!\r\nDid someone mention me?","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"53bb692b6368727415bc0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SeraphimDawn\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53bb68c56368721f7d280000#post_53bb68c56368721f7d280000\r\nWell, then he kidnaps me.","author":"513e68eda4c72d4e3b000164"},{"id":"53bb7c246368726b03c20000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://cdn.list25.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/ringcollapse2.gif!\r\n!http://cdn.list25.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/michaels_01.gif!\r\n!http://cdn.list25.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/highfive.gif!\r\n!http://cdn3.list25.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/OMG.gif!\r\n!http://cdn3.list25.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/badwrestling.gif!\r\n!http://cdn3.list25.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/rope-fail.gif!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"53bb7e3d63687277677a0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@twistedmetalero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53bb7c246368726b03c20000#post_53bbr7c246368726b03c20000\r\n\r\nMexican wrestling is more real than that.","author":"31bee2686368722a0df23600"},{"id":"53bb7e8863687248b50b0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Gizoid101\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53bb7e3d63687277677a0100#post_53bb7e3d63687277677a0100\r\nWho says it needs to be real to be enjoyable?","author":"513e68eda4c72d4e3b000164"},{"id":"53bb7edb63687226fba20100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Gizoid101\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53bb7e3d63687277677a0100#post_53bb7e3d63687277677a0100\r\nI don't think anyone over the age of twelve believes that Professional Wrestling is real.
