Literally the only information you are given is that there is a woman being interviewed and there was a murder. You have to figure out everything by listening to these video clips. \r\nThe twist comes in the form of the database's UI which is the most unintuitive shit ever. See, you type in a word and if the woman says that word in a video, it'll come up as a result but it only shows the first five results. On top of that you _have_ to use the search system, you can't just view all the videos in order. That probably sounds frustrating but I thought it was pretty engrossing. Listening to every word she says, picking out ones that could render useful results, taking notes on events she talks about For later reference. It kinda made me feel like a detective piecing together a cold case. \r\n\r\nThe actual story does have some interesting twists here and there but it's nothing amazing. \r\n\r\nAlso you don't really \"beat\" the game. I mean there is an ending scenario but it's just a little bit of text. Text that is very substantial to the story but still only one or two sentences. [/bq]\r\nI like it\r\nAlthough jut seems more like a pat/woolie game than a Matt/woolie game \r\n","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"559eede263687269cd000397","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SidewardManatee\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/559eedbb63687269cd000365#post_559eedbb63687269cd000365\r\nI'm reading that Monster Girl manga that you liked.","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"559eee15636872718f000859","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!https://40.media.tumblr.com/13512d06a6aada48611900f682914448/tumblr_nr7b1aMbk61s2kojso1_540.png!","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"559eee336368723ae2000f8f","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/559eed58636872718f000774#post_559eed58636872718f000774\r\nI understand. \r\n\r\nAlso take as long as you need.
