Not Mile's screaming, god no. That ended hours ago. Its hard to scream when a cop's bullet rips your throat open. Mostly the screaming is the kind that's always been there, the reason why I was in the institute to begin with and why me and Mile's had to leave so... dramatically.\r\n\r\nUsed to be that the screaming never made sense to me. It was just... just mindless noises eternally echoing through the cramped confines of my skull, but these new drugs they got me on? I swear I can make out words now. Directions.\r\n\r\nThis is the first time in my life that I've ever been able to make sense of that awful fucking noise, but the shrinks said that was bad. They wanted me to go off the drugs and I won't go back to that empty, mindless howling.\r\n\r\nI really didn't have a choice in what I did after that. Most of them weren't too bad so far as shrinks go. Talked down to ya, but none of them ever tried to feel me up anything. I tried to be as kind as I could, but Miles...\r\n\r\nThat fucker always did have a temper on him. Poor Dr. Brown. I'll never be able to forget the way he gurgled while Miles...\r\n\r\nNo, better not to think about that. Violence makes the screaming worse, I think whatever's doing it likes to see people getting hurt. Swear it sounded like someone cumming when I cut Ms. Lawrence's throat.\r\n\r\nThat one's gonna haunt me. She was such a nice woman, always listened to me, always tried to tell me that the thing screaming isn't real, and that I should never listen to it.\r\n\r\nAnyways... I lost the cops a ways back. Should really ditch the car, and Miles. Gonna miss the bastard, I gotta say. Only other one I met that could hear the screaming in his head.\r\n\r\nRest stop up ahead.","author":"4f41ee04945b701c41002af7"},{"id":"55ac72c36368726e070009ed","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Silent_Witness\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55ac726c6368727e42000849#post_55ac726c6368727e42000849\r\nI thought that was a lampshade hanging on how Buttercup never really said that.","author":"554d477e63687270dee30600"},{"id":"55ac72c46368726e070009ee","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@QuasarNova\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55ac726b6368726e07000968#post_55ac726b6368726e07000968\r\nTe entiendo, yo estoy en silla de ruedas.","author":"520901737f123b14a50000d8"},{"id":"55ac72df6368727e420008c2","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@gasmaskangel\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55ac72c36368725bc0000d8e#post_55ac72c36368725bc0000d8e\r\nYou've been shot in the neck?!","author":"554d477e63687270dee30600"},{"id":"55ac730b636872610a000bec","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Meresflut\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55ac72c46368726e070009ee#post_55ac72c46368726e070009ee\r\n\r\nHuevos, en serio?!","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"55ac73506368725bc0000e8e","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Virgil Stormblade\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55ac72df6368727e420008c2#post_55ac72df6368727e420008c2\r\n\r\nPretty sure he's paraphrasing a book/fic/movie/TV Series","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"55ac736a636872102200040e","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Virgil Stormblade\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55ac72df6368727e420008c2#post_55ac72df6368727e420008c2\r\nNah... that was Miles.
