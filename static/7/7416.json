See that some brat has opened at least 20 blind bags. Thinking that I can perhaps get a slight discount on them (there's a security camera nearby, so they'll know that I didn't just open them trying to get a lowered price), I pick up the box of blindbags. I'm wearing an adventure time hoodie, and I'm about to walk out of the aisle when I hear \"OMG I LOVE ADVENTURE TIME\". I'm thinking it's some 13 year old, based on the voice. But it's not. It's a twenty year old who clearly has something wrong with her.\r\n\r\nLong story short, she talks off my ear about a Canterlot Wedding and Equestria Girls (berates me for not seeing it in theaters), yells at my mom to make me take down her email (spitfire@hotmail.com or some shit), and steals my box right out of my hands, stuffing the toys down her pant pockets.\r\n\r\n\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/559e916a636872794500029f#post_559e916a636872794500029f\r\n\r\nSomeone said that on broadcast television, my friend.
