The good news is we don't have to worry about it going nuclear if it develops into a region wide war.  The bad news is that if this does go where it's probably going we're talking several decades of war with a fuck ton of countries getting involved to stop ISIS's expansion.\r\n\r\nIf it does go down that way we're not talking a traditional world war, rather ISIS's expansion getting so large that countries that don't want to get involved start getting dragged into it and nato countries getting dragged into it with decades of war against insurgency trying to contain them and reverse their control.  Basically imagine the iraq war on steroids and everyone getting dragged into it against their will.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Ukrainian news:\r\nPro-Russian forces are losing ground now and it's pretty certain at this point that eastern Ukraine is going to stay a part of Ukraine.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53b883ca6368726537290000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"Kamen rider Faiz henshin sounds\":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2lH1ADCxq4","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"}]}
