Right now the popularity took off like a rocket.  Before the anime started it was already popular, but now that it has a anime it just in a week shot through the roof.\r\n\r\nEven if you don't like harem anime I would still suggest watching it cause the fanservice in the show is used for comedic effect rather than how a lot of anime the fanservice is creepily placed.  If you hate harems the anime is still pretty good; if you hate fanservice the anime is still pretty good.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"55a8808963687209a600009c","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Number1pegasus\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55a87fee63687208c1000052#post_55a87fee63687208c1000052\r\nno, the rock is a terminator\r\nthe mother fucker was laughing about his finger snapping\r\n\r\n\r\n\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55a8802863687263b600058d#post_55a8802863687263b600058d\r\nbut he might destroy you like he did the moon ","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"55a880ad63687208ef000112","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SeraphimDawn\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55a880016368724a740001eb#post_55a880016368724a740001eb\r\nA creepy Fraxit.","author":"509f70a87f123b77eb0004fd"},{"id":"55a880e563687209a6000114","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55a8808663687263b6000603#post_55a8808663687263b6000603\r\nWhat if I just hate anime?\r\n\r\nNo squiggy!
