At one point, my mom would ask me to help her or I would go to the toilet. Now, we had only one TV and one remote so in order to maintain my dominance over the remote, I decided to hide it. My siblings did it as well, even my mom did it. So, why the hell not? I hid my remote and did my thing. It didn't even last half an hour and as I sit back down on my couch, I noticed something was missing.\r\n\r\nI lost the remote. And I forgot that I was the one that hid it.\r\n\r\nI spent two hours searching for it and a quarter of the time, I spent watching TV by switching channels manually from the recorder. Afterwards, I was able to find it, got angry, insulted whoever that hid it (which was me, so basically insulted myself) and noticed another thing missing.\r\n\r\nI lost the batteries, which I hid as well but forgot. \r\nSo fuck.","author":"4fe1b9f47f123b13df002976"},{"id":"559be8606368724978000707","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@HJSDGCE\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/559be79f63687207840011b5#post_559be79f63687207840011b5\r\nSounds like that Bollywood film \"Ghajini\"\r\n\r\nAnyway, You should really watch it it's very good.","author":"52f0834d63687261cba90300"},{"id":"559be9556368724836002536","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Albus Fahrenheits\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/559be8606368724978000707#post_559be8606368724978000707\r\nDespite my memory being terrible, that was the one thing out of a few other things that I remembered.
