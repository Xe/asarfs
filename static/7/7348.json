It was his 27th birthday today, but nobody came. He sent invitations to his relatives and to people who he thought were his friends. But still, nobody came. Daft blew out the candles on his cake, wishing that the invitees would die for stabbing him in the back and not showing up. Just then,he heard a knock at the door.\r\n\r\nDaft jumped up and over to the door and opened it. Standing there was a lankey effeminate guy with long hair. He looked like some sort of g*y emo. \"Uh... may I help you?\" Daft said. \"I came to help you Daft\" said Wyldfire. \"Huh?\" Daft was obviously confused.\r\n\r\n\"May I come in out of the rain?\" Wyldfire said. \"uh...sure who are you?\" Daft answered as he Wyld into the house. As soon as daft shut the door, a blinding bright light shone from wyld. When the light disappeared, Wyld had transformed into a humanoid fox.\r\n\r\n\"W-wyld?!? I t-thought...you are...you are really a\" stammered Daft Punk. \"Yes daft, I am a kitsune.\" Wyld smiled, his whiskers moving with his cheeks. Daft stood there amazed, unable to believe his eyes. \"I'm sorry wyld, I never knew...\" \"shhh its ok. I only show my true form to people I love.\"\r\n\r\nThese words moved Daft to tears. He always felt something for wyld as a human, but he never thought wyld was really a kitsune, and he never thought that a kitsune would love him back. \"I have a gift for you Daft\" said wyld in a sly voice.\r\n\r\nWyld dispensed of his raincoat and he stood there, naked in this anthro-fox form. There was a bow wrapped around his waist. \"Ohhh wyld, I love you so much\" cried Daft, who immediately ranover and hugged wyld. They both kissed, wyld's whiskers tickled Daft's cheeks, but he loved it.\r\n\r\n\"This is the best birthday gift I've ever received!\" said Daft. Wyld grinned at him and said nothing. While they were kissing, wyld began to take off daft's clothes. First his pants, then his shirt, then his underwear. Daft and wyld were both butt naked, embracing eachother.\r\n\r\n\"I want to so much\" Daft said to wyld, looking into his beautiful yellow eyes. \"I want you too honey.\" murred wyldfyre, his Kitsune -blam!- beginning to emerge from the sheath.\r\n\r\nDaft reached around the kitsune and undid the bow. Then they both went over to the bed, wyld laid Daft on his back and spread his legs. \"Do you trust me daft?\" said wyld. Daft nodded, looking art wyld's shaft which was now all the way out, the swollen not at the base. A scent of musk filled the air.\r\n\r\nDaft felt wild poke at his tailhole, then he groaned as wyld slid his length in. He could feel the canid -blam!- throbbing against his prostate and he groaned. Wyld bent down to kiss daft, and then he thrust. Daft groaned into wyldfyre's maw as the knot stretched his tight little -blam!-.\r\n\r\nWyld pulled out, only to thrust right back in, he shuddered with pleasure. Daft's own -blam!- was now erect and leaking with pre. \"Oh gods! don't stop wyld!\" wyld didn't stop. In fact, he picked up the pace, thrusting into Daft again and again and again.\r\n\r\nThey both moaned and kisses, hugging eachother while they resumed their unholy act. Wyld grunted like a beast and daft crooned like a little girl as they both neared their climax. Then, daft screamed, the orgasm taking him by surprise and he shot all over wyldfyre's stomach. Wyldfyre, hearing daft scream and feeling his muscle spasm around his -blam!-, roared, and he shot jets of -blam!- into daft's tight -blam!-.\r\n\r\nJust then, the part arrived. Daft's mother and father, and all of his friends entered the apartment just in time to see daft getting -blam!- by a fox thing. They were so horrified that they all had simultaneous heart attacks and died. Daft's wish was granted.==][/spoiler]\r\n\r\n[==the -blam!- stuff is from the site's cuss filter==]","author":"50a843d47f123b2e7c001359"},{"id":"559b677b636872343700030e","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"BABY YOU'RE A FIREWORK","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"559b682b6368723ed30009d0","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@hype\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/559b67566368721b26004ef8#post_559b67566368721b26004ef8\r\n\r\nWho the fuck is Daft?
