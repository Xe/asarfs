I worked _damned_ hard in my youth and beat my body up something fierce too, so now all the aches and pains of that are starting to catch up with this old man.

Now I have been through three marriages, raised two kids, and spent my entire life working hard. The day I hit 55 I'm throwing my hands up in the air and screaming \"DONE.\" I will officially be done with doing anything, my bucket list by then will be completely filled out (all that's left is \"see my daughter graduate\"), and I am embracing an existence of pure sloth and decadence.
