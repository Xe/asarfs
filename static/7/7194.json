If you're one of those \"woohoo!  Make everything a shonen cause it makes it instantly better!\" this is a prime example of why removing the core aspect of a franchise to appeal to the lowest common denominator is a bad idea.  They removed everything people liked about Kantai and made the main character completely boring as fuck to appease to everyone and as a result it was a fucking trainwreck.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the exact instant Kantai started losing popularity Monster Musume's popularity started spiking. . literally the exact same time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTl:dr; \"Hey everybody!
