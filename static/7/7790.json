Now, this wouldn't be a problem if he didn't try to pull his mom to places he wanted to go and started crying if she didn't follow.\r\nAnother kid was a brat who wanted to play with my games when I said they couldn't (since the news was on) and while he didn't cry, he argued and ORDERED me to turn it on. At one point, I did but didn't give him the controller until he asked politely, he just sat there and sulked while relentlessly demanding it.\r\n\r\nI don't care how young a child is or how influential or powerful their parents are. If you even think that you're above me and act like it, I will punish you. And the best part is? I will make sure their parents agree with me. I may sound sadistic or any other crazy word but while I like children, I don't like overlords. \r\n\r\nYou want something? Be humble about it. \r\nYou want something you can't have? Accept that fact.\r\nYou think you're high and mighty? I'll make you think otherwise.\r\n\r\nThis applies to people of all ages.","author":"4fe1b9f47f123b13df002976"},{"id":"55ad077f6368721438000307","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@HJSDGCE\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55ad068a6368723bcc0000ba#post_55ad068a6368723bcc0000ba\r\nYou'd make a great parent!

A little firmness goes a long way.\r\n\r\nThe children of my family friends are fucking insane. The girl is apparently some star gymnast, so much so that she's been taken out of school so that she can hone her skills every single waking day. She gets homeschooled, sure, and there's other kids at the gym so she has some semblance of social skill, but there's one problem - being a star gymnast means that you're used to attention twenty four seven. So when she doesn't get any from her parents, she gets miffed and will quite literally stand at their side while they're talking and go \"dad, dad, dad, dad, dad...\" \r\n\r\nBut at least she's better than the _boy._ Holy shit, the boy. I guess this is what happens when your sister is a hotshot athlete, because he doesn't just want attention, he _craves_ it. He will do absolutely anything for you to simply look at him for even a few seconds. He needs to go to bed? He'll walk out shirtless and in underwear in the middle of a conversation just so everyone can hear his mom yell at him and he can retort with \"but I go to bed NAKED!\" He even stooped as low as to insult our host, who he said was fat, had a girl voice, was \"gay\"...and it wasn't even his parents that stopped him, it was everyone else around him! He started throwing glass bottles at trees, told me that he would rape Barbie, and when he saw that I was playing \"Bowser's Inside Story\" on my DS, proceeded to tell everyone at the table how the game involved bugs bursting out of Bowser's sinew and a whole host of disgusting stuff. Keep in mind that he was talking to middle aged women who have never held a DS in their life. Had to comfort his poor mother that it wasn't _really_ about that so she didn't think that her son had a M game on his hands.\r\n\r\nThey get yelled at, sure, but they don't get _disciplined._ And that's the problem.\r\n\r\nThe real kicker is that I'm the one who gets to babysit them when they're too \"rowdy\" instead of their fucking parents. I had to sit through two hours of a Fred movie marathon because it was the only way they'd sit still. Everyone at the event was congratulating me for \"taking charge\" and it's like, wow, is this how low we've sunk?","author":"5041b54f7f123b77af00a442"},{"id":"55ad0cc0636872321a0007e6","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@And Brother I Hurt People\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55ad0abe636872766800266b#post_55ad0abe636872766800266b\r\nOh jesus christ that sounds like an absolute nightmare!
