No one ever tries to denounce Buddhism it seems.\r\n\r\nIt makes me feel like brushing up on the cosmology and morality in Zoroastrianism so I can bust down doors by going, \"Well actually...\" and starting talking like the Christian-oriented people are wrong, and not just the Atheists.\r\n\r\nBecause Zoroastrianism is fun like that. Ahura Mazda don't care really, all he did was make everything and as then put his time into fighting Angra Mainyu. Everything else is up to you, you may be punished for it during your life, and you better certainly define your shit by action and not talking about it.

In the US it isn't Buddhists insisting that we have a sticker in every biology textbook disclaiming evolution, nor are Zoroastrians picketing funerals waving signs about how \"God Hates Fags!\"\r\n\r\nAlso if you are an atheist posting on the internet, which I am, odds are good that you broke away from the Abrahamic faiths. In my case it was a particularly vile strain of Christianity which was really big on Hell, the general corruption of the modern world, and most of all on how gracious God was to care for a filthy disgusting little sinner like me, so forgive me if I've got a bit of grudge.","author":"4f41ee04945b701c41002af7"},{"id":"52d75eb06368723a63bd0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@gasmaskangel\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/52d75bb4636872388e030100#post_52d75bb4636872388e030100\r\nI bet you wish you lived in asia. . . No seriously. Buddhism, taoism, shintoism and several other religions that originate from asia have no problem with intellectualism and actually a fair number of buddhists are atheist.  What I mean by that is atheistic buddhism is basically the philosophy minus the religion; no belief in god required.
