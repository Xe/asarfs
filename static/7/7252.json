The usa and japan.\r\n\r\nWhat is the country that makes the most anime?  Do I even need to bother?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy is this important?  Because the demand continues to sky rocket.  Conservatively speaking estimate wise in say ten years the video game market will probably be yearly worth 300 billion.  The anime industry, although I don't have a definitive estimate on me, will continue to increase.  Global demand for the two is continuing to increase.\r\n\r\nWhat does this mean in the long run?  Imagine how many people are going to play nerdy stuff or watch anime or such?\r\n\r\nThat probably explains so much drama too, cause political groups realize how big the two things are growing and want to turn it into propaganda.  In say fifteen years or so chances are ISIS will be claiming gays in video games is \"islamophobic\" or some crap.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5597476f63687228ab0009bd","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Virgil Stormblade\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5597473f636872672900071e#post_5597473f636872672900071e\r\nToo old for my taste.
