Basically because she didn't go the hospital immediately they said that it wouldn't stand up in court.  What's worse is I've seen shit like this in Texas and it seems to be the norm.  Another instance was years ago a friend of mine turns out her husband was raping their daughter for years and it took fricking ages to get him put behind bars; I think the way they arrested him was cops were at their house waiting for him to try something if I'm not mistaken.  Another instance I've seen was a church I went to a person got arrested for hitting his wife and raping her in front of their kids and guess what?  He walked away free.\r\n\r\nOn paper Texas is supposed to actively fight this shit, but the cops basically have their hands tied behind their backs in all sorts of bullshit and told to \"do their job\" while being dissuaded from looking into events.  Unless the cops here witness a rape first hand then there's a damn good chance that the person will get away with it cause the way Texas handles rape cases is that to use a analogy they would have to catch you while you're robbing a bank in order for them to have enough evidence to arrest you.\r\n\r\nI'm not blaming the cops, rather there's some severe red string bullshit that ties their hands behind their backs that pretty much makes them useless in these cases.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53bf5ad86368727f86d40400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53bf5a3663687201e8b40300#post_53bf5a3663687201e8b40300\r\nIs there ANY way to fight this bullshit!?","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"53bf5b346368727eff870400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53bf5a3663687201e8b40300#post_53bf5a3663687201e8b40300\r\nthat sucks\r\nNo other words\r\n","author":"4fe16df67f123b13e400003f"},{"id":"53bf5bd563687201b1690400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://38.media.tumblr.com/a0398ffe6372ab21766d2d771ddb42fc/tumblr_n80w1oIlmB1rv50z1o1_1280.jpg!\r\n\r\nseeing myself regretting things\r\n\r\nWHY IS THIS SO FUCKING ACCURATE.","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"53bf5c056368727e660b0500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@twistedmetalero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53bf5bd563687201b1690400#post_53bf5bd563687201b1690400\r\n\r\nWell, it's getting high as fuck","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"}]}
