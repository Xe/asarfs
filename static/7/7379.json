I have one VERY minor gripe about it.\r\n[spoiler]His finall outfit is kind of goofy. And yes I get that Daredevil is a blind man who regularly takes down ninjas and shit and he's kind of a goofy character to begin with. But I think because I saw his first outfit so much I got more attached to it. And one of the things I REALLY liked was that his old black mask covered his eyes completely. Because that makes sense. Why would a blind man need eye holes in his costume? If they had just kept the eye covering in his new mask I wouldn't complain as much.[/spoiler]","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"559ca3c263687265a20001b1","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/559ca33163687265640000e1#post_559ca33163687265640000e1\r\nSomething told me Tryon would be a pain in the ass to Transform!\r\n\r\nJust type down the transforming animated in the Anime, Thinking about how that'd work in Toy wise is pretty hard!
