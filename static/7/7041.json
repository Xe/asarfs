The reason specifically why it will be legalized is Kennedy is a moderate and looks at it a legal viewpoint; the anti-gay marriage side has no justification legally as to why the bans should be upheld and they have no justification as to justify causing essentially a constitutional crisis.\r\n\r\nTl:dr; gay marriage is probably going to be legalized in the usa on monday cause the anti side can't justify their arguments legally.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"558a3cc5636872687a0004c6","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SidewardManatee\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/558a3c4763687219460008d6#post_558a3c4763687219460008d6\r\n\r\nDo you have an ax with you?","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"558a3cc9636872617d000d24","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@MoogSourceVermona\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/558a3c8a6368726ace000402#post_558a3c8a6368726ace000402\r\nYou have displeased my Stomach with such nonsense.
