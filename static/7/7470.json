Right now there's only about 50 games that offer oculus support.  Remember when the WiiU launched with not a lot of games?\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the porn industry doesn't give a fuck about other porn companies making porn games and are actually working together to develop support together.  They don't have a lot of money, but they're not pissing away their money.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"55a010746368727a69000097","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Princess♠Molestia\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55a01007636872413d00019e#post_55a01007636872413d00019e\r\n\r\n!https://derpicdn.net/img/2014/11/9/761131/large.png!\r\n\r\n!http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/948/207/d20.gif!","author":"5041b54f7f123b77af00a442"},{"id":"55a01091636872413d000266","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55a010366368727a69000051#post_55a010366368727a69000051\r\nUnfortunately even if the people in charge know what it will get used for, they have to keep it PC","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"55a010ef636872024d00066b","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55a01091636872413d000266#post_55a01091636872413d000266\r\nThat's why I think VR for consoles is going to die out.
