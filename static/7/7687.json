I like to say that the left became too right for my taste, in that they basically have the same mentality (disregard for the truth, treating their own views like a dogma, assuming the worst of everyone who doesn't 100% share their opinions...), even when they have different views.\r\n\r\nOf course, that's personal impression and it's very likely that they always were pretty similar. But now that SJWs are so normal and pervasive, they're worse than they ever were before.\r\n\r\n\"Helped\" by big corrupt left-winged news sites, whose... style is very similar to Germany's biggest (and, unsurprisingly, most corrupt) newspaper, that is practically a Nazi pamphlet. In that way, it also feels oddly fitting that this very right-winged paper made witch hunts on celebrities who were face with false rape allegations (together with our most infamous feminist, no less).","author":"5179b098a4c72d9b7f0028ee"},{"id":"55a963dc6368721fe000020f","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55a9623b6368721c7d000082#post_55a9623b6368721c7d000082\r\nOh, that one's good ","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"55a9641563687237e3000729","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55a963dc6368721fe000020f#post_55a963dc6368721fe000020f\r\nI want a Lion.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"55a964ea6368723832000758","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55a9641563687237e3000729#post_55a9641563687237e3000729\r\n@A lion with a pocket dimension?@","author":"31bee2686368722a0df23600"},{"id":"55a9652663687237450008d9","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Dashu\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55a962546368721fe000007a#post_55a962546368721fe000007a\r\nI totally agree here, but for different reasons.  When you get down to it the national democratic party and the national republican party are the same part; they just have different justifications for their views.  What I mean by this is that they are both extremist authoritarians.\r\n\r\nIf either party had the capability to watch every usa citizen 24/7 and install cameras in people's bedrooms to make sure that people aren't doing anything they deem \"wrong\" you bet damn well they would do it in a fucking heartbeat.  If either party had the capability to watch people 24/7 online to make sure that people aren't posting \"wrong\" political opinions they'd do it in a fucking heartbeat.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you get down to it both democrats and republicans think of 1984 as a instruction guide; they both want that kind of world.\r\n\r\nYou want to know what is the biggest proof that mindcontrol rays don't exist?  Cause neither republicans or democrats have used it.  If mindcontrol rays physically existed they would in a fucking heartbeat activate it and would sleep easy at night without any level of guilt.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf democrats aren't authoritarian then how do you explain \"drone daddy\" Obama; Obama's own administration has actively admitted that they have used drones on usa citizens several times.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"55a96539636872410500028c","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Holy shit...","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"55a9664363687209d6000113","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55a9652663687237450008d9#post_55a9652663687237450008d9\r\nThat's just sick.\r\n\r\n","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"55a9685b636872092b00052f","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55a96539636872410500028c#post_55a96539636872410500028c\r\nThe ending?","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"55a96998636872027500014c","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SeraphimDawn\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55a9664363687209d6000113#post_55a9664363687209d6000113\r\nHey remember when Obama promised that he would close Guantanamo Bay?

I may not be a christian, but targeting christian groups is fucking bullcrap.\r\nAuditing monetary contributors of Mitt Romney.\r\nThe VA scandal.\r\nThe TSA molestation scandals.\r\nCanning the space shuttel.\r\nIllegally using drones in Syria without Congressional approval.\r\nIndefinite retention of usa citizens without telling them what they are being held for; that's right you can be held in prison for your entire life without being told what you're in prison for without being allowed a lawyer.\r\nWhistleblowing on the usa can get your ass thrown in jail.\r\n\r\nFor bonus points look up the Chicago blacksite; it's has literally been proven to be real and Obama was aware of it cause during the NATO summit they arrested protesters.\r\n\r\n\r\nTl:dr; I may be liberal leaning, but fuck obama, fuck democrats and fuck progressives.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"55a96ab2636872031e000300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55a96998636872027500014c#post_55a96998636872027500014c\r\nObama should go back to afruucca.
