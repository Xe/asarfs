Such a suit would be highly impracticable and too costly.  The closest you'll ever see is a combat suit where it has a mechanism for quickly being put on.  Less of a transformation and more of the suit snaps on quickly.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53c31edd636872300b600000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Okay.

The reason why that would be a bad idea is that NASA is currently looking at revamping space suits by instead of using air pressure to keep the astronaut pressurized using pressure of the suit to keep them instead; the reason why having a transformation mechanism with that sort of space suit is that it would break every bone in your body.\r\n\r\nEven if you could get past the problem with how in all probability it would break every bone in the person's body the materials to make it actually strong enough to handle real world combat would be insanely fucking expensive.\r\n\r\nIt gets worse in that even if you could get past all those problems the chances of a critical failure would be too high.  What I mean by this is that a single bolt or screw breaking during a transformation would turn the user into a soup.\r\n\r\nTl:dr; such a suit would turn you into confetti.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53c3218263687206022f0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"*Falls asleep suddenly*","author":"50b70eeb7f123b1a02000097"},{"id":"53c321c26368722a7f0f0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Randomosaur\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53c3218263687206022f0000#post_53c3218263687206022f0000\r\nI have no choice.
