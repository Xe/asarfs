The kings who knew nothing about what caused the great meltdown of 7049 (supposedly). They knew nothing. But maybe they did. Maybe they knew why Sigmasis stepped down from his reign in 7001.\r\n\r\nYes, Sigmasis couldn't take the shame, the guilt. He was the head of the mass Mech-genocide of 6294. After that year, all robots built were emotionally unstable. Killing their own mothers and fathers, their creators. Those who cared for them. It was he! I suspect that the iron kings knew of this and being the sadistic fucks they are, allowed this barbaric and sick murdering to continue until 7000 when Synopsis managed to hack into the Iron Kings mainframe and paralyse them for 49 years. He did this so no one could stop him as he fixed the chaos Sigmasis wreaked.
