Like [spoiler]\"I have seen little [looks at Kylie's bare wang then resumes eye contact]  to indicate that could effectively protect Sarah Conner\" and the fact that he kept her drawings she made as a kid[/spoiler]\r\n\r\nAnd I like that they went the goofy route with it In places. At this point I honestly think any sequel past the third movie should start delving into goofy shit anyway or else it gets boring. I mean it wasn't exactly highbrow humor but I enjoyed it.
