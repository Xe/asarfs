He takes it off and I put it on and ask him how it looks. He looks at me with a completely straight face and says \"Looks kinds gay on you.\" So then I ask him \"Wait does the chain make ME look gay or do I make IT look gay.\" To which his only response was \"Yes.\" Then we proceeded to cackle like idiots for five minutes.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"55ab39c0636872365c000fd7","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55ab39696368727995000060#post_55ab39696368727995000060\r\nThat's pretty funny","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"55ab39f8636872123c0004de","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55ab39c0636872365c000fd7#post_55ab39c0636872365c000fd7\r\nWe laugh at stupid shit all the time.
