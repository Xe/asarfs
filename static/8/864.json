If the company you work for is caught discriminating based on race if it goes to court the company's fucked if they're a small company and the person refuses to settle out of court.\r\n\r\nThat's why you rarely hear any cases around discrimination actually having a ruling on them cause 99% of the time the consequences are so severe that companies will try to settle out of court.  A business would have to be darwin award levels dumb to not settle out of court.  It's not that there's not a lot of lawsuits based on discrimination, rather the overwhelming majority of them are settled out of court.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53c9a57c6368721f87710000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53c99e6d63687254d7300100#post_53c99e6d63687254d7300100\r\nThat's brilliant.\r\nNow all we need is for the Westboro Baptist Church to fucking die.","author":"515ddf93a4c72d8a1f000d57"},{"id":"53c9a7b06368722971cb0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@ParagonCommander\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53c9a57c6368721f87710000#post_53c9a57c6368721f87710000\r\nIt's probably one of the biggest things Obama will be remembered for because there is no wiggle room or exemptions for it; if your company does business with the government and you are caught discriminating against glbt you're fucked.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53c9a7b363687277710e0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53c9a3856368724995640000#post_53c9a3856368724995640000\r\nPeople such as PT have been known to exploit their \"protected status card\" for their own gains, to silence critics, minimize or even have their crimes pardoned.
