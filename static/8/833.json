You never hear about the game, only the music.[/bq]\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nA more in depth explanation is that it's a bullet hell game; bullet hell games the last decade have been getting shat on hard to the point that without a doubt touhou is of the top two game franchises in the genre due to there's next to no actually good bullet hell games left anymore.\r\n\r\nYou know those old school arcade cabinets where you where hundreds of bullets would fly at you and you would have to dodge them?  That's what a bullet hell game is.\r\n\r\nThe games are bare bones though and that's a good thing.  The reason why a lot of bullet hell games are so shitty is that they throw in a ton of crap that detracts from the games.  What I mean by this is that the reason why you never hear about bullet hell games anymore is that the majority of the current ones coming out have the mentality of \"420 mlg sup@ l33t skllz0rz\".\r\n\r\nTouhou is good in that not only is it fucking insanely hard, but the games are pretty damn near perfect and the music is perfect.  Literally the only problem with the games is the art; Zun is not a artist so you can probably guess what that means.\r\n\r\nIf you want a idea of what playing touhou is like then watch this video:\r\n\"!http://en.touhouwiki.net/images/thumb/3/37/Th143cover.jpg/256px-Th143cover.jpg!\":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInpkQz5Z90\r\n\r\nAlso there's not just bullet hell games, but fighting games as well so if you're not good at fighting games you can just play those.  If you're not good at the games then there's the manga.  Don't like humor based manga(inaba of the earth and inaba of the moon; also oriental sacred place)?  There's slice of life manga(forbidden scrollery & one armed hermit).  Don't like slice of life manga?  There's pure fantasy manga(silent sinner in blue).\r\n\r\nDon't like bullet hell games, fighting games, humorous stories, slice of life stories or fantasy stories?  There's the products made in co-operation with others such as the art books made by I don't remember the guy's name.  Don't like art?  Then there's the music.  Don't like video games, manga, art or music?  Then there's the novels.  Don't like video games, manga, art, music or novels?  I don't know what else I could list.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53c6b1f76368721af4280500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53c6b0c86368721b4a6b0400#post_53c6b0c86368721b4a6b0400\r\nWell then, I didn't know much about Touhou before, but that was as good an argument as any to go check it out. \r\n\r\nIf it eats up my life, you owe me a new one.","author":"53c5c4df6368727632970000"},{"id":"53c6b29f6368721b4aed0400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Spatial\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53c6b1f76368721af4280500#post_53c6b1f76368721af4280500\r\nHonestly to be a complete video game review snob and nitpick any and all problems with a franchise no matter how little or unimportant it is the *ONLY* problem with the entire franchise is that zun isn't a artist and that's literally it.
