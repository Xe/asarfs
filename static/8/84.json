They don't have a failsafe \"Oh you're too good at playing this game so we're going to knock you down a peg\" button or a failsafe \"Oh they have too much health, better spawn a enemy right on top of him out of thin air to take 90% of his health so the game is harder\" button.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand if you spawn 50 enemies out of thin air on top of a character and they take out 99% of your health and you have no way of defending yourself as your keyboard input is temporarily disabled by the game and then you have to go fight a hundreds of enemies all at once with only 1 hp left just cause the game thinks you're playing too well that's going to piss off a lot of people.\r\n\r\n(yes I did just play ghosts and goblins today for 8 hours)","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"532fe42863687211e60a0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/532fe1f56368724ae20e0000#post_532fe1f56368724ae20e0000\r\nI've played Ghosts and Goblins before, I've beaten it too, My Thumbs hurt for months","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"532fe89863687211e6530100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/532fe42863687211e60a0000#post_532fe42863687211e60a0000\r\nGit gud :V\r\nBut in all seriousness I know how you feel.\r\n\r\nIt's been a while since I've played a game this hard.  99.99% of the time when a game claims to be difficult what they really means is \"on occasion if your health is too high or you haven't died we'll just occasionally spawn enemies out of thin air to take away your health\".\r\n\r\nGames should not punish a player for being too skilled and unfortunately far too many now are punishing skilled players to give the illusion that their games are more difficult than they actually are.  What I mean by this is let's use a analogy; if you play fps games have you ever had a occasion where enemies spawn right out of thin air in front of your face then blows you to paste?
