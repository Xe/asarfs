That's what you wanted, right? Well, I've decided I don't like people like you. You've messed with the community of the wrong psychopath. Before you get excited, you haven't even made me angry. I am a hard person to make angry. However, I despise people like you.\r\nYour pitiful hacking skills are hilarious. Hacking accounts and putting up proxies are level 1. Can you hack into encrypted files? Can you tear through firewalls without leaving a mark? Your silly little proxy won't protect you. I've hacked into many computers and spied on the users. I've hacked into games. I have been hacking since I had a computer. It's what I was raised to do.\r\nYou have no idea to the extent of fear which you should be feeling. All you are is just a community of internet creeps. Have you ever murdered anyone? I have no empathy and I will probably feel joy peeling your skin off your face.\r\nYou think I'm giving you an empty threat? Believe that. I have contacts in dark places that you don't want to know about. If you live even close to me you better fear for your life.\r\nTrack my IP if you want to, but I am smart enough to use a library computer. Hack into my account if you want, but it'll just make it easier for me to track you.\r\nWith love,\r\nA psychopath\r\nP.S. I would fear for your life while you still have it.","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"53cc7aca6368720c97670000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Ore-O\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53cc7a546368720e245d0000#post_53cc7a546368720e245d0000\r\nI actually haven't checked in over a week.

There is a reason why people say they fear cops cause trust towards the position as a whole has eroded to the point where unfortunately a lot of people fear police more than actual criminals.  If you live in a city where the cops are corrupt, like NY, Oakland or such you sadly have more to fear from them.\r\n\r\nI'm actually surprised this video surfaced cause the number of cases where police officers have beaten up people with video cameras then file \"obstruction of justice\" cases against them is sadly through the roof.  If you have a cameraphone and are filming a police officer you may very well be picking your teeth up from the concrete.  If you have a camera you better fucking film it from a distance instead if you don't feel like going to prison.\r\n\r\nI'm massively surprised they didn't kill the cameraman as well.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53cc81a86368723eae630000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53cc80616368720bd5470200#post_53cc80616368720bd5470200\r\nThey must not have noticed him.","author":"513e68eda4c72d4e3b000164"},{"id":"53cc996563687256c9b50000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!https://31.media.tumblr.com/01865cc72e4d71c13de15e70bd88cb5f/tumblr_n91he9hjNd1r1dqpyo1_500.png!\r\n!https://38.media.tumblr.com/4ca6c15a165582a2c69befe17434fc90/tumblr_n91he9hjNd1r1dqpyo2_500.jpg!\r\n!https://38.media.tumblr.com/00dc3b23837152ab0485d417dc9eae89/tumblr_n91he9hjNd1r1dqpyo3_1280.png!","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"53cc9f086368721144790000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"/mu/ is making a love song to /mlp/ now","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"53cc9fc66368721370910000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@twistedmetalero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53cc9f086368721144790000#post_53cc9f086368721144790000\r\nAwwwww.
