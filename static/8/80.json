I'm going to talk about religion for a moment, but you know how the news constantly goes on about how \"religion is dying\" and talks about it either being some sort of doomsday or how the world is somehow supposed to become some paradise where everyone singing joy to the world?\r\n\r\nI ran into something that challenged that; the person theorized that no religion isn't going extinct, rather it's evolving and that religions and denominations that refuse to evolve are what's the main driving force behind the loss in adherents.\r\n\r\nI know I'm going to use the usa as a example, but it's just a analogy so don't get your panties in a bunch, the main groups that are losing in the usa are the ones that absolutely refuse to adapt to modern times and refuse to believe it's 2014 not 1950.\r\n\r\nThe more realistic scenario is yes agnosticism will continue to rise in the world, but not 100% like people are saying it will, rather it will constitute a majority(not super majority) and religions who accept that it's 2014 and not the 1500's will continue to prosper while religions and denominations that refuse to change their way will be the ones that go extinct.\r\n\r\nIn other words religion isn't going extinct as a whole, rather churches and temples that refuse to get with the times are the main driving force behind the loss in number of adherents.\r\n\r\nI actually have seen real life examples of this; back when I was christian the church I was going to in a single month had the entire youth program nuked to non-existence and it never recovered, the same thing happened with the college group.  Originally the two groups had fifty people and in a single month it was reduced down the five people(minus the staff).  Why?  Cause when something came up they refused to admit that the younger generations had a different mindset on it and went, \"*NO* you must have our mindset!\" and poof there went fifty members.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"532dea3c6368722645250000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Wheat, barley, rye, buckwheat, oat, corn, rice, potatoes, cassava, or other?\r\nWhich staple is your preference?","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"532deaee6368727bff600000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SeraphimDawn\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/532dea3c6368722645250000#post_532dea3c6368722645250000\r\nDoes hops count?","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"532deb106368724e6ca40000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/532deaee6368727bff600000#post_532deaee6368727bff600000\r\nYeah...","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"532dee0a63687267a0a90000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SeraphimDawn\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/532dea3c6368722645250000#post_532dea3c6368722645250000\r\nSounds like the ingredients for a craft beer.","author":"5010fa077f123b1e4f00104e"},{"id":"532def206368723e8c270000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@someguy111\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/532dee0a63687267a0a90000#post_532dee0a63687267a0a90000\r\n\"It's the ingredient that gives certain beers its flavour\":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hops.
