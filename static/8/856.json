Wait; I stand corrected; per day there's 10,000 people crossing the border and Syria *HAD* a population of 22 million in 2010.  22,000,000(in 2010)-2,000,000(number of refuges in august 2013) = ~20,000,000/10,000per day= 2000 days/365.25(leap year guys)= ~5.48 years or ~5 years, ~5 months as of august 2013 - it's been seven months since august 2013 = ~4 years, ~10 months.  ~Five years from now Syria will cease to exist.\r\n\r\nIf you're wondering what the ~ means is that it's just another way of saying something is a ballpark estimate.  When I say five years from now Syria will cease to exist I mean around that ballpark; it could be sooner or later depending on what happens.\r\n\r\nAs of February 2.5 million confirmed people left.  Don't ask for a 100% accurate estimate cause I don't think anyone really knows for certain.  All I really know is Syria is fucked.  Even if someone were to win the massive amounts of people leaving will doom the country economically and population wise for decades upon decades.  To put it simply: it's pretty safe now to take off Syria from the list of nations cause whenever the fighting ends the population will be be massively reduced to the point the nation will not be able to recover.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53c861fa6368727fbabb0300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Oh my heart\r\n\r\n[spoiler]!http://s29.postimg.org/rnhq5tprb/20140714_092618_1.jpg![/spoiler]","author":"31bee2686368722a0df23600"},{"id":"53c8622b6368727f0bf90300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Gizoid101\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53c861fa6368727fbabb0300#post_53c861fa6368727fbabb0300\r\n\r\nbeautifull","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"53c863176368727eab550400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@twistedmetalero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53c8622b6368727f0bf90300#post_53c8622b6368727f0bf90300\r\n\r\nIndeed.\r\nI wanted to eat it, but the teacher didn't let me.","author":"31bee2686368722a0df23600"},{"id":"53c863f26368727f83ce0400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Gizoid101\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53c863176368727eab550400#post_53c863176368727eab550400\r\nYou sure know how to eat someone's heart out.\r\n*rimshot","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53c8648a6368727f5e330500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"so 4chan /mu/ created a new rap sub genre\r\n\r\n!http://i.imgur.com/bqWlSTp.jpg!\r\n!http://i.imgur.com/z7lkwB2.jpg!","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"53c8648c6368727f834e0500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Gizoid101\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53c861fa6368727fbabb0300#post_53c861fa6368727fbabb0300\r\nDid Kano get this heart?","author":"513e68eda4c72d4e3b000164"}]}
