The problem with this is that hypothetically speaking imagine if the whole world was united under one country that everyone accepted instead of how we have 196 countries.  All that money we put towards war would instead be used towards development and other governmental departments.  What I mean by this is that imagine if instead of spending a trillion dollars a year towards our military we instead used that trillion dollars towards NASA, education and other civilian departments?\r\n\r\nIn other words the crux of your argument is that your point relies on the belief that any and all civilizations must operate 100% like ours without any sort of deviance.  The problem with this is that if sapience evolves in a herbivore species that is non-competitive would develop a non-competitive cooperative society instead and thus drastically reduce the probability of self destruction.\r\n\r\nThis belief further falls apart even on our own planet in that there's countries and cultures where cooperation is viewed as more important than competition.\r\n\r\nIn other words your theory only works towards either carnivorous/omnivorous species and only in cultures in which competition is more important culturally than cooperation.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53c3731a63687258ef5c0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"*Throws the faiz gear over to TME*\r\n\r\n待て。僕がスーペリアギアを呼ぶ。\r\n\r\n*The Kabuto Zecter flies into my hands*\r\n\r\n変身！\r\n\r\nヘンシン！\r\n\r\nキャストオフ\r\n\r\nキャストオフ！\r\n\r\nチェンジビートル！","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"53c376846368726f47190000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"YEAH BITCHES, I DID IT\r\n\r\n100% sleeping dogs completion.\r\n\r\nall jobs, all favors, all missions, all trophies, all clothes and vehicles, all achievements.\r\n\r\nALL, EVERYTHING.","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"53c376b96368726eee490000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53c3723c636872682b970000#post_53c3723c636872682b970000\r\nCooperation is a fine and good thing, but competition is what drives innovation. Hell, that's not just how culture and science advances its how natural selection itself works. No, its not nice or good or pretty, but its how life works.\r\n\r\nAs evolved life forms we bare the scars of our upbringing. Its in our lusts, our fears, our mistrusts and our ambitions.\r\n\r\nEven herbivorous species can be shockingly violent towards each other. Vegetarianism is not a guarantee of peacefulness.\r\n\r\nYou claim there are countries and cultures that value cooperation over competition. Care to name them? Go through their histories? Really get into their culture?\r\n\r\nWe're not built for cooperation on anything other than a micro level. Loyalty to family and tribe because those are the ones we see and interact with every day, that's what gets hardwired into our genes. We had to learn how to not be bastards, and we've come a long fucking way baby.\r\n\r\n*EDIT:* Not that I'm not enjoying this debate but I'll have to get back to you on the subject in the morning.

What I mean by this is that there is more to evolution than just survival of the fittest.  The last couple of hundred years humans have evolved surprisingly fast not cause of natural selection, but because of cultural pressure on the genepool shaping which genes become widespread and which die out.  To put it bluntly we've evolved beyond natural selection and culture is playing a much larger part towards our evolution as a species now instead.\r\n\r\nOn the micro scale let's say in a culture it's no longer considered culturally acceptable for a person to be naturally violent and go around beating the shit out of anyone that talks back to them; that will have a effect on humans evolution in that the genes that promote violence will be \"pushed\" out of the genepool.\r\n\r\nWhat is essentially happening with human evolution is that on a macro scale traits that promote culturally unacceptable behavior are being pushed out of the genepool.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53c379656368724825590100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"Ass Weasels\":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCR8xV7fb5w\r\n\r\n[spoiler]Yeah, I'm tired...[/spoiler]","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"53c37a216368726fbf0d0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SeraphimDawn\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53c379656368724825590100#post_53c379656368724825590100\r\nMorning.","author":"515ddf93a4c72d8a1f000d57"},{"id":"53c37abe6368727fb3ed0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53c379436368726ff7d30000#post_53c379436368726ff7d30000\r\nMankind does not need violence to be malicious.
