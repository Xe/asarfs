What that means is there probably will be ten or so states to repeal their bans by the end of the year and there's going to be a bukakke of courts striking down the laws going into 2015 and by the end of the year it's just going to be the deep south and a couple other states desperately clinging on.\r\n\r\nEnd of 2014:  \"Gay marriage now legal in just over half of the country\"\r\nEarly 2015: \"Gay marriage now legal in the vast majority of the country\"\r\nEnd of 2015:  Deep south, \"*IT'S NOT OVER YET!*\"","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"532e6a366368723b642d0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/532e69bd636872186a970100#post_532e69bd636872186a970100\r\nI'd imagine places such as Texas will be stubborn strongholds.","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"532e6ae0636872440f370100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SeraphimDawn\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/532e6a366368723b642d0000#post_532e6a366368723b642d0000\r\nThe texas ban got struck down; it's going to the circuit court though.\r\n\r\nChances are by the end of the year gay marriage is going to be legal in texas.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"532e6ced6368722036520000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/532e6ae0636872440f370100#post_532e6ae0636872440f370100\r\nEven if the government is committed to taking them down.

It's a southern state for sure, but it's nowhere near as like say mississippi or such.\r\n\r\nLet me put it this way, republicans are quaking in their boots that they may lose texas in due to wendy davis having a real actual shot at flip turning the state's political leaning upside down coupled with the high hispanic population and that the younger generations are now leaning left.\r\n\r\nAbott has a 50% chance, wendy davis has a 40% chance.  If wendy doesn't win in 2014 then they have really grim news in 2016 if clinton runs.  If clinton runs she'll take texas no questions asked.\r\n\r\nI currently live in louisiana and let me put it this way; I always thought how people describe the state as racist and homophobic were exaggerations and no they're not; sundown towns and purely white schools.
