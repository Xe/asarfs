To use a analogy let's say humans desire for victory overpowered self preservation, now imagine what would have happened during the cold war if the desire for victory overpowered the desire to live.\r\n\r\nIf say in the micro scale someone pulled a gun on you and you in turn pulled a gun on them; what would happen if the self preservation instinct wasn't powerful enough to overcome the desire to shoot?","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53c36aaa6368726529590000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"・・・やったゼ！","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"53c36ac66368724d8c860000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53c36aaa6368726529590000#post_53c36aaa6368726529590000\r\n\r\ni dont speak alien.","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"53c36acb63687279dd130000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I'd also like to have Neanderthal children.

If as you say aliens are so much more peaceful than us, then what drives their innovation? Pure altruistic love of knowledge. Not goddamn likely. Unless they live in a post scarcity society which would itself require absurdly advanced tech, then it means that their scientists are as beholden to the people holding the purse strings of society as ours are, and even less likely to get funding because you've removed one of the key reasons we innovate.\r\n\r\nWe might have gone to the moon without the Cold War, but it sure wouldn't have been as fast.\r\n\r\nAlso it frankly offends me how little credit you're willing to give humanity.
