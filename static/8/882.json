They have to immediately allow access to the scene or the rebels and Russia will be considered the perpetrators, but they can't allow access to the scene cause they're still destroying evidence.  Basically the rebels have to destroy any evidence within the next couple days and find and destroy the black box(black boxes are a borderline indestructible) or they will not only be considered guilty, but now considered a terrorist organization to which Ukraine can ask EU and NATO members to participate in anti-terrorism operations legally.  The rebels have days to destroy everything or else the EU and NATO can be asked to come in and kick their ass because they will then be considered a international terrorist organization.\r\n\r\nTl:dr; the rebels in Ukraine are fucked cause they're probably by the end of the week going to get carpet bombed into oblivion.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53cb0523636872633f580100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"Heavy armor B-fighter\":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rTVam7o72A","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"53cb068c6368726101460100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53cb04ee63687262d64e0100#post_53cb04ee63687262d64e0100\r\nSo, how do you hope this will end?","author":"513e68eda4c72d4e3b000164"},{"id":"53cb079d636872626ed90100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53cb04ee63687262d64e0100#post_53cb04ee63687262d64e0100\r\nThat is going to be a bloodbath.
