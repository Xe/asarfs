But the basic premise floats on the something akin to Anon getting to Equestria, being lewd, and knocking up a character (or several, or several different anons bang several, whatever. They openly permit variation and there's no organized \"canon\") that produces pony-styled Satyr offspring.\r\n\r\nImages and greentext - as far as I've read and follow here on Derpibooru - tend to explore one of the many possible universes in the Satyr thread and the functional/dysfunctional family relationship between Anon, the pones, and the Satyrs.\r\n\r\nIt's strange, but it's kind of fun and there's a charming thing to it. And they seem to know how to hold a thing going if it's been a thing for 54 threads and more than a year at least.","author":"4fe4bf947f123b175b000001"},{"id":"539f7cc06368723bb95a0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@AaronMk\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/539f7c436368723bed610000#post_539f7c436368723bed610000\r\n\r\n\r\nAH the satyr images.\r\n\r\ni have seen a couple of those here, at first i was creeped by the idea but i have grown to love them.\r\n\r\ni sometimes lurk 4chan but not all the time, cause the way everything is design its pretty awfull in my opinion.","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"539f7d846368723b73070100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@twistedmetalero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/539f7cc06368723bb95a0000#post_539f7cc06368723bb95a0000\r\n\r\nIt is pretty bland in so far as web design goes.
