Maka is as kind as she is tenacious. But she's also super neurotic about her partner Soul getting hurt, She's super fucking adorable. Never used for fanservice. And on top of that, she gets the SHIT kicked out of her. Of the main trio of Maka, Kid, and Blackâ˜…Star, Maka and Soul are unarguably the weakest. And her getting stronger is one of the driving forces for the series. She isn't some \"strong, independent girl who don't need no man.\" None of that bullshit. Maka is a genuine character.
