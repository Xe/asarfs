I am quite torn.[/bq]\r\nI'm probably going to get a ton of shit for this, but I'm with you on this.  I don't like pokemon.\r\n\r\nWhat I would like to see from a monster capture game is a combination of pokemon and digimon and add in a bit of real time battles to it.  What I mean by this is like how with digimon there's a couple basic baby digimon to which they then digivolve into a assortment of possible rookies to which then they have a wider assortment of champions and a even wider assortment of ultimates and megavolutions.  So only like one or two starters total to which they then evolve into say thirty possible tier two evolutions each then each of those can evolve into say three or so tier three evolutions each then two or so tier four evolutions.  It would make it so if you don't feel like going out and getting monsters by backtracking you can just raise the one you want.\r\n\r\nAlso real time environment battles.\r\nAnime:\r\n!http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/639/793/d61.gif!\r\nActual battles in the games:\r\n!http://25.media.tumblr.com/17d44e2a3da264785a406c796cadfee0/tumblr_mgb1pabo5c1r3ifxzo1_500.gif!\r\nThat's just straight up false advertisement guys.  Admit it folks would totally jizz all over the walls if the pokemon games were actually like this clip of scyther vs onix.[/bq]\r\nI'd also want a real time Pokemon Battle game. Maybe even warfare.","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"53a5f933636872197b3d0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"http://huffingtonpost.com.sundaytimesdaily.com/clinical-study-shows-atheists-have-far-lower-iq%27s-than-believers/r/32458\r\n\r\nFor Randomosaur","author":"4fe16df67f123b13e400003f"},{"id":"53a5f98f6368721894600000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@twistedmetalero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53a5f8e163687217a4340000#post_53a5f8e163687217a4340000\r\nThat doesn't make JRPGS bad like you guys seem to think","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"53a5f9af636872196b7f0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53a5f5e96368721a586d0500#post_53a5f5e96368721a586d0500\r\n[bq=\"trashboat\"]\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53a5f55a6368721b85f50400#post_53a5f55a6368721b85f50400\r\nThere's a difference between Western RPGS and JRPGS you know[/bq]\r\nYou do realize that the gaming industry has specific terminologies for specific types of gameplay right?  And that just cause a japanese company makes a game doesn't mean that there's a gaming police that goes around shooting anyone that emulates that right?  Like just cause pokemon originates from japan doesn't mean that if a american company makes a monster capture game that the police and swat team will come barging in shooting everyone on sight for \"violating the difference between jprg and western rpg games\".\r\n\r\nWhat I mean by this is to use a analogy just cause fps games are popular in the usa doesn't mean japanese companies are forbidden to make fps games as well.\r\n\r\nAlso if I told you how much of AAA video game production gets outsourced to other countries chances are it would make some people cry that their favorite game wasn't 100% made in japan.  To further slap this argument almost all of the time during video game production does a large portion of a game get outsourced; just cause a game says \"nintendo\" or such on it doesn't mean that third party companies weren't involved to some degree.  It's actually really good that so much of video games' asset production are outsourced cause some times you run into problems that you can't solve and thus need a second opinion on or help on.  What I mean by this is that when a game says, \"JRPG\" what they actually mean is, \"the game developer's main branch at which this game was developed was in japan and that a large portion of the game may have been developed outside of japan though\".\r\n\r\nWhy does the video game industry function like this?  Cause it would be straight up near impossible to get anything done on time if none of the production was outsourced and delays would be the norm and be months on end.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53a5f9b963687219cd4e0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SeraphimDawn\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53a5f91b63687217c2220000#post_53a5f91b63687217c2220000\r\nWarfare Pokémon game is already out.\r\n\r\nPokémon Conquest anyone.","author":"505696b47f123b37e800effa"},{"id":"53a5f9cb63687217f2660000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SeraphimDawn\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53a5f91b63687217c2220000#post_53a5f91b63687217c2220000\r\nOf course we want that, We all want that, The problem is that he's Saying that the Current style is bad because It's not like The Origin","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"53a5f9fa63687217938e0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Whatevs\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53a5f933636872197b3d0000#post_53a5f933636872197b3d0000\r\nWell played.
