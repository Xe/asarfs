Jack, Samson, and Gertrude. Samson is the youngest and he is TERRIFIED of storms. And last night we had a pretty bad one. Poor dog looked like he was gonna have a panic attack. So I put down my 3DS, go over to the dog bed, and I sat there gently petting his head and talking to him so he would calm down. I did that for about an hour and a half while the storm died out, Next thing I know, I wake up on the dog bed with Samson snuggled up against me.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"55269e2e6368724f62550300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"It's Morning\r\n!http://33.media.tumblr.com/608709a61346e783e3e7be6b70f53af4/tumblr_n678klMCgd1szn6h0o1_500.gif!","author":"505696b47f123b37e800effa"},{"id":"55269f736368724f62b90400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"For those of you with allergies\r\n!https://41.media.tumblr.com/e8f210be0eec246511ff5a1f6348fa26/tumblr_nk8hyxpUN31rjpadvo1_500.png!","author":"9ba2e84e636164642cc03200"},{"id":"5526a21f6368723b5a9c0b00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"It's now 10:00 PM somewhere else\":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNu6EJx5zu4","author":"505696b47f123b37e800effa"},{"id":"5526a8bf6368725985650e00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"fwewaweeewwweeewweeewewewewEfawew","author":"511c09ec7f123b35980001eb"},{"id":"5526aab96368724433ea0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@igotnopicks\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55269b1063687257c21c0c00#post_55269b1063687257c21c0c00\r\nThere, I spoilered it.","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"5526acd56368724433230200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"So what have my pets been up to in their master's absence?","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"5526ad4d636872670f220500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5526acd56368724433230200#post_5526acd56368724433230200\r\n\r\noh, you know\r\n\r\nbeing absent\r\n\r\n-and problems-","author":"511c09ec7f123b35980001eb"},{"id":"5526ade26368724420840300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5526acd56368724433230200#post_5526acd56368724433230200\r\nNothing much.","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"5526af856368724420e10400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://simg3.gelbooru.com//images/54/20/5420bb2d3a410bd3b496963924f48071.jpeg!\r\nIs it bad that I can still tell each character apart based solely on their swimwear?","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"5526b6db636872670ffb0f00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5526af856368724420e10400#post_5526af856368724420e10400\r\nPink one has nice legs","author":"54ff97db636872754d922f00"},{"id":"5526b7296368725985ce2500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@masquerade\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5526b6db636872670ffb0f00#post_5526b6db636872670ffb0f00\r\nNagisa-chan.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"5526b8aa6368721df30f0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"agudibagabisanuuubi","author":"511c09ec7f123b35980001eb"},{"id":"5526ba096368721d5c7c1800","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5526acd56368724433230200#post_5526acd56368724433230200\r\nBeing the undefeated of the east!\r\n\r\nAnd yelling at each other.
