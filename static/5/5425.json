The world's first prosthetics olympics is scheduled for 2020.  The reason why all this starts to tie into each other is that if you look at performance levels of prosthetic 2000 vs 2005 vs 2010 vs 2014 there's been massive jumps in performance vs price; the reason why there's a fullblown olympics scheduled for 2020 for prosthetic users is that in a couple years prosthetic limbs will start to outperform human limbs meaning that people will start to run faster and jump higher and have greater control over them than natural limbs; by 2025 or potentially earlier is when those high performance prosthetics will be within your average consumer's budget.\r\n\r\nWhat does this have to do with Plain Doll or asfr?  Easy; look at advertising models: hyperidealism.  To put it another way when we do have high performance prosthetics the way they will probably be marketed to people that still have their limbs is hyperidealistic models with high performance limbs.  Simply put the new \"sexy\" thing won't be skinny models or such, but rather uncharacteristically hyperidealized faces with high performance prosthetics. . . aka asfr; or women/men that have pretty faces and such, but the rest of their body is high performance machine parts not meant to be 100% human looking but rather to show off why it's a better product than the competition.  Basically probably a lot of people are going to reject looking 100% human but instead try to make it look like their body parts look like the equivalent of a sports car while trying to make their natural body parts look hyperidealized.\r\n\r\nBasically imagine how people bling out their cars; now imagine people blinging out their prosthetic limbs.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"}]}
