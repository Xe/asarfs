(That is if mole men don't decide to bust your wall don while you're sleeping that is)\r\n\r\nAnd the thing about One punch man is that they do put in other character's that are strong but not as strong as Saitama to mix it up.\r\n\r\nAnd some of these bad guys are not push overs themselves. and it turns out its a good thing Saitama is around because if he wasn't everyone would be fucking doomed. Yeah the S-Rank hero's can beat a lot of these assholes but the question is for how long? \r\n\r\nThe monster's just keep getting stronger and stronger. Hell my favorite Arc \"From Space\" the bad guy kicked Saitama to the freaking moon.\r\n\r\nNow imagine if that was someone else? Instant death.
