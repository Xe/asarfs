The movie's _mean gurls_ do all that \"devastating\" crap that antagonists in teen flicks are wont to do to this one unaffected character; eg. spilling water on her shirt, tripping her in the lunch room, accusing her of cheating with shitty and obviously photoshopped photo proof. Except she's an actual fucking human being and doesn't care about any of this because it really doesn't matter, ignoring her equally stereotypical friends' advice on how to get even (\"If you become the prom queen, everyone will automatically love you!\"). The mean girls escalate their attempts to devestate her, eventually resorting to murderous methods.\r\n\r\nI'd watch it.","author":"5041b54f7f123b77af00a442"},{"id":"55354d246368721e6ca71f00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55354b1d63687210ef710800#post_55354b1d63687210ef710800\r\n\"@Number1pegasus\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55354b236368721e6cba1b00#post_55354b236368721e6cba1b00\r\nLONG EXPLANATION TIME!\r\nDevil Fruits come in three varieties. Paramecia, Zoan, and Logia. Paramecia types affect your physiology in some way. Be it turning you into rubber (Gum Gum) allowing you to create earthquakes (Gura Gura) or allowing you to separate your body parts (Chop Chop). They are the most common type of DF and usually the most varied in terms of ability. The Zoan type allows you to turn into an animal. Giraffes, wolves, falcons, leopards, hell the Hito Hito will turn animals into more human like creatures a la Tony Tony Chopper. Zoan type users can alternate between three forms. Human, animal, and hybrid. And then there's the Logia type. The Logia type transforms your entire body into a particular element. Fire, sand, ice, lava, hell even LIGHT. Logia are the rarest DF type and generally regarded as the most powerful.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"55354d3563687207af3c0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"...can't tell if browser hiccuped, or if Derpi ate my post.","author":"5041b54f7f123b77af00a442"},{"id":"55354e5a63687237cfeb0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@And Brother I Hurt People\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55354d0963687210ef760b00#post_55354d0963687210ef760b00\r\n!http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/enhanced/webdr01/2013/6/11/16/anigif_enhanced-buzz-13155-1370981302-1.gif!","author":"31bee2686368722a0df23600"},{"id":"55354f0a63687237cfce0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Gizoid101\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55354e5a63687237cfeb0000#post_55354e5a63687237cfeb0000\r\n\r\nPretty much.","author":"5041b54f7f123b77af00a442"},{"id":"55354f3c63687207afb90300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@And Brother I Hurt People\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55354d0963687210ef760b00#post_55354d0963687210ef760b00\r\nI'd watch it too! \r\n\r\n\r\n\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55354d246368721e6ca71f00#post_55354d246368721e6ca71f00\r\n*I WANT THE ZOAN FRUIT!*\r\n\r\n*I WANT TO BE DRAGON/CROCODILE MAN!* ","author":"50c204917f123b31440000a5"},{"id":"55355018636872306e572100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55354d246368721e6ca71f00#post_55354d246368721e6ca71f00\r\nZoan pls\r\nPreferably something cute and fuzzy.  \r\n\r\nAnd then a gum gum if they figure out how to get two at once working.
