The flaw of the eugenics argument is that it assumes there is some sort of immutable and universally desirable ideal of what it means to be human.\r\n\r\nThis is of course a nonsense as our understanding of ethics and morality is constantly changing and evolving as culture shifts and changes.\r\n\r\nHowever there are certain things we can all agree that humanity can go without, mostly assorted genetic diseases and disorders that make life a hell for so many people.\r\n\r\nIdeally this sort of advancement would be used just to eliminate these sorts of plagues. I do take issue with the idea of designer children however.\r\n\r\nEven beyond the assorted playing god arguments, I just do not think it is ethical to design a child to suit the parent's tastes.\r\n\r\nNow if their were a way to modify existing bodies to easily change their form and function, I'd be all over that shit. I love people who change their bodies in nutty ways, putting a stamp of ownership on your own body like that is all kinds of rock and roll.","author":"4f41ee04945b701c41002af7"},{"id":"5549a4696368720544720500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@PaskaNaakka\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55499ffb6368720544060300#post_55499ffb6368720544060300\r\nSame as here in BC Canada...
