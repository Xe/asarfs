well, it might be a _tad_ biased but sure\r\n\r\none day, a young and naive person from the group i used to frequent was browsing reddit and found these things called \"tulpas,\" and since he had little social skills he decided it would be easier to make friends than... uh, make friends. so he started telling other people, and some of them were like \"cool, i'll check that out!\" and ofc it caught the attention of the new lunar republic, a group where callous and brazen people (who were mostly ex-main group goers) talked shit about everything and everything. i loved the place, so naturally i caught wind of this whole imaginary friend fiasco (and it was brought to my attention by some friends on steam) and joined the tulpa group. first person to be in the group too, aside from admin.\r\n\r\ni was booted because i was in the new lunar republic, but after some work i weaseled my way back in. things weren't too eventful, it was mostly just progress updates and such.\r\n\r\nfast forward a year or so and bungie completely overhauled their site to look like an inbred twitter/reddit child and the main group went to this site called zetaboards. so the tulpa group went to zeta, but i didn't bother with them for a while. after being perma'd for a while from the main group (that's another story) one of my tulpafag buddies persuaded me to join the tulpa group, much to the originator's disdain.\r\n\r\nso, this is where things get past the exposition and get real fucking weird, because it has been a while and developments have occurred. the main guy had 3 tulpae, and only one really posted on the forums a lot. main dude was growing more and more insecure about the seams showing; his tulpa was acting more and more like him as the days went by. another guy was... well he was something, he was a writer with clopfics with self inserts of his oc something, and he had about 8 or so tulpas based upon ponies and anime characters. i'm not sure if i could put the craziness into words with that guy, but apparently tulpas are supposed to live mainly in some imaginary place in your head and his was really strange. he had tulpas killing eachother, fighting all the time, fucking, you name it. hell, even one of his tulpas had a (playful) relationship with another user, who's tulpas were little more than personalities he could manipulate; as one would do with an alt account for espionage or something\r\n\r\nthe two that i were there for got dulled by going there all the time, and what i mean by that is that they started acting too much like one another. the first guy i liked had a tulpa that served as a conscience, probably had the most beneficial tulpa of anyone there. the other was a very intelligent individual, which could not make it past the main creation process. he had a personality down, but when it came to anything else he couldn't do it. so after i realized that i didn't want to go there every day and waste time talking to incredibly annoying people who only talked about LoL or dota i acted like a huge asshole and got my account deleted\r\n\r\nmhm, and i _still_ can't remember the day the japs bombed pearl harbor","author":"50a843d47f123b2e7c001359"},{"id":"551e16726368724c92a80300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@hype\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/551e14936368724d0fc50100#post_551e14936368724d0fc50100\r\n...
