I'm fine with having moe girls and maybe them as the heroes but it's just really unenjoyable when you notice that the ratio of females to males is 5:1, or how the guys are pretty much stupid in most cases. And no, changing a guy into a moe female does not count. It's like saying that \"all guys are dumb and girls rule the world\" or something. I also don't like how they makes certain body parts bigger or smaller AND this applies to all characters. The hell is wrong with variation?! No, changing hair color and style does not count either.","author":"4fe1b9f47f123b13df002976"}]}
