All the looks are there, but the actual mechanic wasn't in place as far as I could tell. So I can't speak for how grindy it'll be.\r\n\r\nThough, a lot of the quests are over glorified fetch quests, or talking to specific NPCS, 75% of the time without quest markers or a proper quest journal at the moment. So you just sort of aimlessly wander around, trying to speak to ponies hoping the server won't disconnect you.\r\n\r\nI raised some points, concerns, and basic suggestions. But then an ass hole programmer came through and gave me an ass hole response after saying how he can't do it.\r\n\r\nBullshit, work around the restrictions.
