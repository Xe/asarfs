Remember how I told you guys about how my step-dad has not only played but completed FF6?  This shit is gonna blow your feeble minds. Okay, for context. My step-dad called me over today because he needed some help. I went over there, and helped clean up the place. Afterwards we sat down and watched some TV. So a trailer for Age of Ultron comes on and he just spontaneously says \"Every time they say Ultron I can't help but think of Ultraman.\" My eyes just go wide and I look at him and \"Whaaa...\" And he goes \"Ultraman! The guy who grew giant and fought monsters and saved Japan. You don't know Ultraman?\"  And at that point I go \"I know Ultraman but how the fuck do YOU know Ultraman?\" And he goes \"I fucking LOVED Ultraman! I used to watch that shit all the time.\" And at that point my brain just exploded.\r\n\r\n[spoiler]TL;DR My step-dad is an Ultraman fan![/spoiler]","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"552b23ce6368721285b80a00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/552b238d6368723e382a1000#post_552b238d6368723e382a1000\r\nCool","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"552b23d46368721285c70a00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Gizoid101\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/552b237f63687224246e1b00#post_552b237f63687224246e1b00\r\nCause he doesn't deserve the name of dante.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"552b23eb6368726083901500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/552b238d6368723e382a1000#post_552b238d6368723e382a1000\r\nKewl.","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"552b24536368723e385a1100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/552b238d6368723e382a1000#post_552b238d6368723e382a1000\r\nYou *have* to get him to watch Mebius!","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"552b245d63687213c5ee0a00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/552b238d6368723e382a1000#post_552b238d6368723e382a1000\r\nI'm pretty sure either ultraman or ultra seven was aired back in the 70's or 80's In america so that makes sense\r\n\r\nAlso your step dad is coolguy\r\n\r\nAnd also a huge nerd","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"552b24856368723e38a91100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/552b238d6368723e382a1000#post_552b238d6368723e382a1000\r\n*YOUR STEP-DAD IS THE GREATEST!*","author":"50c204917f123b31440000a5"},{"id":"552b249a63687213c5390b00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/552b245d63687213c5ee0a00#post_552b245d63687213c5ee0a00\r\nI really fucking lucked out when my mom married this cool guy!","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"552b24da6368723472262400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/552b245d63687213c5ee0a00#post_552b245d63687213c5ee0a00\r\nIt was Ultraman.
