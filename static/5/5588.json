I really love it. Never have I had any run-ins with the \r\ninfamous \"curse\", except for one day at the school prom â€¦\r\n\r\nAs I entered homeroom a few days before the prom, I found a note on my chair. It said:\r\n\r\n\"I saw you at school yesterday, and I can't stop thinking about you! Please go to the \r\nprom with me; my number is below.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a phone number on the note, and it was signed \"Dot Lisall\". I had not \r\nknown any Dot Lisall, but I couldn't get any other date for the prom, so I went with it.\r\n\r\nUpon getting home, I called the number and connected with Dot almost immediately. \r\nWe arranged for us to meet outside the auditorium; I asked how I'd recognize her, and \r\nshe said she'd be carrying a game manual for Sonic R.\r\n\r\nI was ecstatic. I had a date who liked Sonic R as much as I did! I agreed to the date, \r\nand mentioned that I'd be carrying a game manual for that game as well.\r\n\r\nWhen I got to the prom, I saw Dot in person. She had yellow hair, and wore a mostly \r\nyellow outfit. The red ruby pendant around her neck was particularly beautiful.\r\n\r\nWe danced together for who knows how long, and she was a lovely dancer. Several \r\ntimes, she approached the stage and asked the band to play \"Can You Feel the \r\nSunshine\" or \"Living In The City\". The band gave her funny looks every time, and I \r\ndon't blame them.\r\n\r\nAfter the dance, we went off in opposite directions. When I got home, I was practically \r\nin love with Dot Lisall. I spelled out DOT LISALL with my old alphabet blocks.\r\n\r\nI had to get in touch with Dot again. I went to the guidance office the next day and \r\nasked about Dot Lisall, but no student by that name was in the school. The closest \r\nthey could come was Todd Lissinger.\r\n\r\nOnce I got home, I called Dot's number again, but the number was out of service. I \r\ncalled the operator and asked about the number, only to be told that nobody had that \r\nnumber.\r\n\r\nMy sister, meanwhile, had noticed something odd about the alphabet blocks. She \r\ncalled me over to look, then rearranged the blocks bit by bit, and soon the message \r\nbegan to take shape:\r\n\r\nDOT LISALL\r\nDOTLI SALL\r\nDATLI SOLL\r\nTADLI SOLL\r\nTASLI DOLL\r\nTAILS DOLL\r\n\r\nI had spent the prom dancing with a curse.\r\n\r\n-Mark Radical[/spoiler]","author":"5012e49c7f123b4012000341"},{"id":"553971db6368720587070b00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!https://40.media.tumblr.com/9b01ad2f42a22701e218d5edebd17bf0/tumblr_inline_nn74s3C1ef1rqdo0p_540.png!","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"553971fb6368722dee120800","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@igotnopicks\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5539715b6368725847da2c00#post_5539715b6368725847da2c00\r\n:(","author":"37e5b9d66361642500af5e00"},{"id":"553972386368722dee5e0800","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Kaz\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/553971fb6368722dee120800#post_553971fb6368722dee120800\r\nThere are multiple Robins","author":"505696b47f123b37e800effa"},{"id":"553972736368722679270000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@igotnopicks\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/553972386368722dee5e0800#post_553972386368722dee5e0800\r\nMaybe he's friends with pooh","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"553972bf6368726f5beb0500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/553972736368722679270000#post_553972736368722679270000\r\n\r\nDas ist true","author":"37e5b9d66361642500af5e00"},{"id":"553973436368725847e12f00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"*spirals into  deep depression*","author":"37e5b9d66361642500af5e00"},{"id":"5539736e63687205beb30500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Kaz\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/553973436368725847e12f00#post_553973436368725847e12f00\r\nAll day e'ry day","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"5539739e6368722dee720a00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Biscuits are done!","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"5539741363687205be7f0600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/553971db6368720587070b00#post_553971db6368720587070b00\r\nHOLD THE PHONE SIDEWAYS YA DINGUS","author":"9ba2e84e636164642cc03200"},{"id":"553974186368725847523100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5539739e6368722dee720a00#post_5539739e6368722dee720a00\r\nThe only thing I've cooked recently was hamburger steak \r\n\r\nI over spiced it I think.
