Well think of both the current republican party and democrat party as the whig party.

If a anti-authoritarian party showed up it would force both parties to adopt anti-authoritarian ideology or face extinction.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5528a16f6368722844581e00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SidewardManatee\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5528a0fa6368725110770200#post_5528a0fa6368725110770200\r\nWas it worth it?","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"5528a1976368722844851e00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5528a16f6368722844581e00#post_5528a16f6368722844581e00\r\nNOPE \r\nBut I had fun","author":"51a2815b7f123be59500049b"},{"id":"5528a1ad6368721f65f10100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SidewardManatee\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5528a0fa6368725110770200#post_5528a0fa6368725110770200\r\nNow watch a talking cat\r\n\r\nA talking cat is the greatest movie","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"5528a2406368723f44b60800","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5528a1ad6368721f65f10100#post_5528a1ad6368721f65f10100\r\nLater\r\nI need a break...","author":"51a2815b7f123be59500049b"},{"id":"5528a2516368722ca1241200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@gasmaskangel\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5528a0596368723f44820700#post_5528a0596368723f44820700\r\nI fucking knew it.
