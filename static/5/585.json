What's more is that there's a lot of the appeals court dates coming up.  Texas and two other cases will have their opening brief started July ninth, and the plaintiff brief will be due within thirty days; no set hearing date though.\r\n\r\nSo basically almost three more weeks till Texas' brief starts, a month for filing it, possibly a month until the court date and possibly up to a month for a ruling to be made.  So anywhere between two to four months until gay marriage is legal in Texas.  Let's hope they don't try to stall it out.\r\n\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53a50c966368725aeda50000#post_53a50c966368725aeda50000\r\n[bq=\"SquiggyBomb\"]\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53a50c116368725b77760000#post_53a50c116368725b77760000\r\nAwwww uc-kun.
