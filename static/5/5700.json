But Lightsworn man. See in the card game there is this strategy called \"Milling.\"  It revolved around sending as many cards in your opponents deck to the graveyard and making them lose by just running out of cards. The Lightsworn set is kind of like that. Only instead of milling your opponents deck you were milling YOUR OWN deck. Because almost every Lightsworn monster and spell revolved around the graveyard. Hell Lightsworn Dragon gained 200 atk and def points for every Lightsworn monster in your graveyard.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"553ea4eb63687206b2f51800","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Number1pegasus\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/553ea4a563687205d5721a00#post_553ea4a563687205d5721a00\r\nGot new tires.
