I'm having to go back to school cause advertising is dying, everyone and their grandma knows advertising is dying, but people in the field still try to argue that it's not dying.  Over the last two years the advertising field has shrunk by over a half of it's previous size and advertisers say instead, \"it's experiencing a dynamically changing environment through which opportunity presents itself to individuals\". . . Cutting out all the bullshit, how does agreeing that a industry is shrinking at a alarming rate translate into \"jobs are being generated by jobs being lost\"?\r\n\r\nI have to disagree with a lot of people about the problems in the world; stupid people are not the problem; willingly stupid people are.\r\n\r\nThere's a difference between stupid and willingly stupid.

I.e. \"This friday buy the new Ford for $5000 off!\"\r\nThe new way of doing ads is to essentially carpet bomb everyone with ads that can last decades and thus save money in the long run.  I.e. \"Ford  We've been your pa's truck and your grandpa's truck.  Eventually we'll be your kid's truck and his kid's truck.  Ford  The family's truck.\"\r\n\r\nAnd it's so fucking idiotic that they don't want to make such a simple change in marketing products that a lot of companies have already been doing for years.  If they would start making ads that are long term instead of short term they would stop shrinking.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"}]}
