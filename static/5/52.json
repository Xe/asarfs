It's a variation of ubuntu linux.  When you're buying steambox you're pretty much buying a pc that can function also like a console.\r\n\r\nSecond steambox will not be sold at a loss.  That's a main problem with the xboxone and ps4 is that they're being sold at a loss and need so many units made to break even.  Steambox on the other hand no matter how few are sold will always break even.\r\n\r\nThe wiiu is a flop; the xboxone is receiving massive pressure from investors to get shitcanned cause they haven't sold enough to justify making anymore and are currently working on a way to making them crossplatform with pc effectively killing the xboxone in the longrun.  The only competition steambox has is the ps4 at this point.\r\n\r\nThe thing is though is that since the steambox is effectively a lineup of computers every year a new version of steambox will come out; this means by the time a new playstation comes out the new playstation will already be last gen.\r\n\r\nThe main problems right now with linux is that it's not user friendly and it's not easy to get your windows games working on it.  If you want to play pc games on linux you can do it; it just takes a lot of know how that most computer users don't have.  By making steambox linux based they're forcing and themselves are working on making linux to become user friendly and forcing games to become crossplatform.\r\n\r\nAlso directx is starting to get abandoned by the video game industry.  I may be a new squirt about to start college, but they're not even teaching directx as part of the curriculum anymore and are focusing on opengl(which is linux compatible).  This will further force companies to have their games crossplatform with linux.\r\n\r\nThe main reason why companies don't develop games or programs for linux is that there's too many distros(err variations of linux); by forcing games and programs to adopt linux and such companies will be more willing to develop their programs to be crossplatform with linux.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo summarize the purpose of steambox isn't to sell a gajillion units, rather it's to force game companies to have their games as crossplatform.  By forcing games to become crossplatform in five years time the distro of linux with the largest userbase will be steambox dwarfing the other ones.  By having one distro dwarfing the others completely companies will be far more willing to develop programs for linux.  By having all the new games and programs as crossplatform that completely wrecks microsoft's shit; cause which would you have a operating system that costs $100 or a operating system that is free and does the exact same thing with all the programs and games able to work equally on both?  This will in turn completely fuck EA or other large distributors if they refuse to adopt linux as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*Tl:dr;  Gaben is going full on dark souls to microsoft, sony and nintendo by running up to the console arses, stabbing them fifty times, dodging when they do a stomp and continuing this until they're dead.*","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"531b77e263687205da240000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I think Valve is sort of developing their own OS with Linux.

You should wait until it's no longer in beta.\r\n\r\nWhat I mean by that is if your computer can run a game at 60 frames per second then steamos can run it at 63 frames per second; not much of a difference, but by the time it's no longer in beta is should run a lot faster.\r\n\r\nWhat they're doing right now if you go look through the code is that they're fixing a lot of the long term bugs with ubuntu.\r\n\"Oh so this line here runs the risk of causing audio stuttering and this is how we fix it.  Better add the update to the user's updates for today\"  It's really boring technical information of what they're doing, but they're essentially fixing all the problems with ubuntu right now before they officially end the beta.\r\n\r\nYou're not looking at being able to run games hundreds of times faster, cause what they're doing right now is fixing the operating system before they do anything else.\r\n\r\nWait until they officially release the finished version, cause it's in beta and they have to do a lot still to do.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe other thing is that it has stuttering problems cause the nvidia driver is really buggy.  Valve has a partnership with nvidia to only have nvidia cards in steambox so nvidia right now is doing the same thing and getting rid of all the bugs with the linux version of their driver before steamos and steambox officially release.\r\n\r\nTl:dr; it's in beta right now cause they're working on fixing bugs, wait until it officially comes out.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"}]}
