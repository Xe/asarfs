some old stuff you could try 2pacs all eyez on me and the don killuminati and maybe wu tang clan´s enter the wu tang(36 chambers), the beastie boys are more rap rock, and they got paul´s boutique and license to IIL, eminem´s old stuff was also cool specially recommended the marshall mathers lp and the eminem show, stay away from encore, there is also illmatic from nas and ready to die by biggie.\r\n\r\nkanye west stuff is really cool in soul rap, the college dropout, late registration and graduation are really alive, my beautifull dark twisted fantasy and yeezus are good too but they tend to fall more dark.\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom new stuff there is kendrick lamar \"good city maad city\" which is pretty good, he is a favorite rapper, tyler the creator´s album wolf is really good and he becomes far more concious, his old stuff its more violent and dark (he talks about necrophilia, and rape and that stufff) but this album is more ligt hearted, talking about failed and new relationships, dealing with the struggles of the media, the aters and the fame, the bad parts of drug dealing, and being unable to see the dad he so much hates, and his dead grandmother, the only family member who always supported him.\r\n\r\neminems new stuff are still good, mostly MMLP2 he combines a lot of different instrumentals to experiment, so he has rap country, rap rock, electronic rap, and other things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nanyway, this was a really extensive list of what are some of my favorite albums, you can pick one of them, see which ones tickles your fancy, i also know some more obscure stuff i figured you will want to listen to more mainstream stuff before.\r\n","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"539d49b86368727dfe930000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@twistedmetalero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/539d489d6368723089cf0600#post_539d489d6368723089cf0600\r\nWell
