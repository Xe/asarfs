Like the \"mock turtle\" from the snips above. There were also menus that made note of carrying canned food but I can't find those right now; I'll have to talk to him when he gets on next.\r\n\r\nBut I equated that sort of silliness to the sort of fondness my grandma has with the microwave. I don't like to touch our and make up pre-made things from the freezer. Where as she got me some pre-prepared, frozen Philly Cheesesteaks for me; then presented them to me all excited like they're the greatest thing like sliced bread.\r\n\r\nThey're still in the freezer, untouched alongside the catfish I intend to cook hopefully someday soon.","author":"4fe4bf947f123b175b000001"},{"id":"5520c5da6368723e50cf1700","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Meresflut\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5520c58c6368724824a50100#post_5520c58c6368724824a50100\r\n\r\nWe have reserves.
