Cause most of them have been removing the harem aspect, removing the adult aspects, removing the romance and needlessly cramming in action into it for the sake of appealing to the lowest common denominator.\r\nBefore someone goes \"you just hate action!\"; no rather what I'm saying is that the problem right now for harem anime in general is that they've been giving the middle finger to their consumer bases and as a result not going anywhere.\r\n\r\nTo put it another way: Daily life with monster girl is probably going to be a super popular anime because 95% of other harem anime have been giving the fans the middle finger.\r\n\r\nTl:dr; if you want your anime to be popular don't metaphorically give your fans the middle finger.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5519a1cc636872738ec30000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5519a111636872731ccd1400#post_5519a111636872731ccd1400\r\nOoooh!
