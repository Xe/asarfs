What I mean by this is most computer programs and most games with a bit of elbow grease you can get to work on other hardware and operating systems and so forth; right now there's a massive push towards making everything at least on the basic level crossplatform.\r\n\r\nThis coupled with how right now there's a massive push to drive costs down will probably change a lot of things under the surface.\r\n\r\nWhat I mean by this is that in say five years all your games will work on windows, mac, linux, xbox, playstation, nintendo consoles and so forth and a lot of the programs you buy will be cheaper adjusted for inflation.\r\n\r\nBasically almost all your games will work on any device and programs like photoshop and such will be much cheaper.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53a53e7e636872698a960000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://37.media.tumblr.com/df47459a163c831f43bfc41d68194f8e/tumblr_n7ib4xkDV21s2yegdo1_400.gif!","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"53a543086368726a6b5c0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I just discovered girls generation.
