Short version is that the vast majority of modern day christian ideology is completely different form ancient christianity and it has more in common with paganism than jewish ideology like to the point a lot of christian forms of worship are actually pagan rituals, like the very idea of a church or church pews come from pagan rituals and such.  Another example is of modern day interpretations of christian views of \"hell\" are based off the ancient roman beliefs of the underworld or such.  Like Easter was a pagan holiday, Christmas was a pagan holiday and such or so forth.\r\n\r\n\r\nI just thought I'd bring it up cause it's interesting how religions influence one another even unintentionally.\r\n\r\nI just find it interesting how often ideologies are influenced by one another.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5534618263687256b7cd0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@HJSDGCE\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5534610963687261ebe40000#post_5534610963687261ebe40000\r\nHJSDGCE is a dick to starfishes","author":"5007bbdf7f123b112f00023a"}]}
