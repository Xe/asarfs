It sucks but it's true. You just have to push yourself one step at a time. Like maybe start doing push ups or crunches every other day. After a while it will almost be habitual. Then maybe cut out one or two things that you eat that are unhealthy. Not even 100% of the time, just during week days maybe. Find something you could idly snack on that's healthy to fill the void like baby carrots or raw spinach. Or ignore me being a knowitall and come up with something little and productive yourself. \r\nAlso draw. You have more talent than me and if you waste it I'll kick your butt. \r\n\r\nI know motivating yourself can be hard. I personally have a terrible fear of failing so subconsciously my brain goes \"if I don't try I don't fail\" which is a horrible shitty way to look at things. If you have something similar , it may help if you talk to your doctor and maybe get something to manage the anxiety. \r\n\r\nAnd about the porn thing. You're jaded. I know exactly that feeling. You need to get out in the world and do shit that isn't on the Internet. Go to school, get a job or something. I know for a fact that the things I enjoy are so much better if I've been working hard on something. (Which is something I need to get my ass on doing myself)\r\n\r\nSorry if this a nonsensical rambling mess, I just woke up and I love you and want you to feel good. \r\n\r\nEdit: sorry also if I sound like a weird stalker guy. Again, just woke up and emotions happening.
