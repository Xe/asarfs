Jack, Samson, and Gertrude. Samson is the youngest and he is TERRIFIED of storms. And last night we had a pretty bad one. Poor dog looked like he was gonna have a panic attack. So I put down my 3DS, go over to the dog bed, and I sat there gently petting his head and talking to him so he would calm down. I did that for about an hour and a half while the storm died out, Next thing I know, I wake up on the dog bed with Samson snuggled up against me.[/bq]\r\nOh god so cute","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"5526c197636872670f851f00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"~what's 9 plus ten~","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"5526c1ae6368722e49790600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5526c1726368723ae8dd0000#post_5526c1726368723ae8dd0000\r\nSamson HAAAAATES storms.
