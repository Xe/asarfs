I would love to say Crash but it would be too hard to explain. I quit after Crash Nitro Kart. Everything after that is just... no... I loved the original ones on the Playstation, probably my all-time favorite games. No kidding. I loved Bash too, even though it wasn't made by Naughty Dog. I think Wrath of Cortex was decent, even XS / The Huge Adventure on GBA.\r\n\r\nI also like Sonic, most of them. Not that much into the newer ones though. My favorites are prolly the Adventure games and Heroes. Boom is probably the worst thing I've ever witnessed.\r\n\r\nI like Ghosts n' Goblins / Ghouls n' Ghosts and their spiritual successors, Maximo 1 and 2 on PS2. I feel like these games don't get that much respect anymore now that people just spew around stuff about the Souls games.","author":"5012e49c7f123b4012000341"},{"id":"5535c6ef6368723dc2eb2c00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5535c49d63687269070e1300#post_5535c49d63687269070e1300\r\nDibs on being the seducer.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5535c6fe6368726907cc1600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5535c66d63687274a1a10500#post_5535c66d63687274a1a10500\r\n^can I be the buff debuff guy then^\r\n\r\n^or the rogue but fighting is scawy^","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"5535c7616368725849331900","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Number1pegasus\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5535c69f6368724e83190700#post_5535c69f6368724e83190700\r\n[spoiler]Can't let you do that Starfox[/spoiler]\r\n!http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/starfox/images/5/5e/WolfCommand.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20080227062125!
