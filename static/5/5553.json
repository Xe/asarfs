It was ordinary. Not special. That means everyone can have it. Asura thought the only escape from fear was insanity. So much so that he BECAME an embodiment if insanity. When Maka pushed throug her fear to fight Asura on her own she was showing him another way to beat fear. One that didn't rely on insanity. She negated the existance of a Lovecraftian horror. By punching it.
