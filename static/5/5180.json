What I mean by this is that if a woman shows up to a lot of work places in a sunflower dress with a parasol with a hello kitty purse that's not the norm (I don't mean normal rather it's not the defacto state).\r\n\r\nWhile it is good that women don't have dress in sunday dresses all the time there is a unforseen side effect; gender norms are incapable of occupying the same space cause if they occupy the same norm then there's no more gender norms and while a lot of groups aim for the removal of gender norms in a macro scale it's just not a feasible endeavour because while gender norms are weakening there will always be in some form gender norms and by forcibly pushing it in the opposite direction only pushes the gender norms apart.\r\n\r\nBasically what the theory was that in say fifty years it will be okay for men to be either masculine or feminine, but it won't be \"okay\" for women to be feminine and that the more you try to fit against gender norms the more and more you will alienate women who do like to be feminine and make them feel like \"freaks\" for being feminine and as a result the theory postulates that over time more and more men will fill that femininity gap.\r\n\r\nTl:dr; the theory states that there's more and more mtf traps because more and more women are starting to feel ashamed for acting feminine and as a result if it's considered socially okay for men to be either feminine or masculine that men will fill that gap.\r\n\r\nTl:dr of tl:dr;\r\nFemininity ---------------------------- Masculinity\r\nGender norms by decade:\r\n1950:\r\nwomen --------------------------------- men\r\n1990:\r\n------------ women ------------- men -------\r\nToday:\r\n------------------women -- men ------------\r\n2050:\r\n------men ---------------------- women-----\r\n[/spoiler]","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5521b97563687233d96d0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Silent_Witness\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5521b94b63687269c2a40100#post_5521b94b63687269c2a40100\r\nBayonetta is also a better father then Goku,","author":"509f70a87f123b77eb0004fd"},{"id":"5521ba156368727da58f0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Welp, it's time, I just got past 500 posts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n~so yeah~","author":"5012e49c7f123b4012000341"},{"id":"5521ba356368723c93980500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@ArcticEight\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5521ba156368727da58f0100#post_5521ba156368727da58f0100\r\nDUN DUN DUNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN!","author":"509f70a87f123b77eb0004fd"},{"id":"5521ba6063687208645d0600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Not sure if this one works, but what do you guys think?

Going on foreign sites the immediate reaction by men in other countries is \"american women are just men with boobs\".\r\n\r\nWhile I completely think that's uncalled for, and before you accuse me having the same belief no I don't, I was just talking about it cause it shows that the usa is developing a huge problem socially; essentially if in say 20 years it's no longer socially acceptable for women to be feminine wouldn't that pose a problem considering how many men like feminine women?\r\n\r\nTl:dr; what's going to happen to the usa if the majority of men are no longer sexually interest in women anymore?","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"}]}
