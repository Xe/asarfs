Basically, it shows Finn playing with living dolls that are based on the people of Ooo. The dolls do whatever their real life counterparts do but in a more simpler way. Finn can control their lives and they won't even notice it because they live in their own different world. So, he's kinda like the invisible God to them. In short, the Sims but less digital and more living doll like. It's a pretty good episode and you should watch it.\r\n\r\nNow, I'm bringing this up is that if you have these dolls but are based on characters from a certain series in fiction, what series would it be and how would you control their lives?","author":"4fe1b9f47f123b13df002976"},{"id":"5540a9176368725f05e92b00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I just remembered that I had an \"I voted for pedro\" shirt as a kid\r\n\r\nI didn't even like napoleon dynamite \r\n\r\n\r\nwhat was wrong with me ","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"5540a95a6368723ae2cd2400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5540a9176368725f05e92b00#post_5540a9176368725f05e92b00\r\nGross","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"5540a9946368723ae2412500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5540a95a6368723ae2cd2400#post_5540a95a6368723ae2cd2400\r\nI look at my old shirts from back then and I _cringe super hard_","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"5540e69463687261fb2f0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I was at the supermarket recently and when looking through bags of spices, I found a bug in one of them.\r\nA LIVING BUG.\r\n\r\nThe spices were made by the supermarket instead of a different company so I took the bag of spices and when at the cashier, I showed it to her after paying for it all.
