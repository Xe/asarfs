As far as I can tell there's no errors or nothing; anyone have a similar problem?\"\r\n\"Well did you follow the steps in the instruction?\"\r\n\"Yes I followed them\"\r\n\"Did you turn your computer on and off?\"\r\n\" - _ - . . seriously?  I'm just trying to find if anyone else has ever encountered a similar problem and you're asking me if I turned my computer on and off for a compiling error?\"\r\n\"Well if you're going to use linux maybe you should go to college and learn this before you attempt to use linux master race\"\r\n\"Are you fucking stupid?  I know how to do this and I am in college right now for programming classes and going to be taking programming for the next year and a half\"\r\n\"Well maybe you should wait until you graduate to use linux\"\r\n\"Fucking idiot\"\r\n\"You're the one that can't get such a easy program to work\"\r\n\"[insert techno mumbo jumbo here] Okay let's see you try it\"\r\n\"Oh that's easy; [tries it] . . . uhm . . . well you see . . maybe you should google it?\"\r\n\"You have no idea what's wrong do you?\"\r\n\". . . Err; it could be something to do with your graphic's card?\"\r\n\"Fucking retard\"\r\n\r\nMoral of the story:\r\nIf you constantly go on claiming you know everything then you're going to look like a fucking idiot whenever someone has a question you don't know the answer to.  Like how today I argued with someone in class about the book being wrong about their conversions for a math equation; the book said to use percentage format, but the equation only worked in decimal format and I got blown off instead of addressed.\r\n\r\nI'm starting to think programming isn't anywhere nearly as hard as people say it is; rather it seems as though a lot of programmers are extremely egotistical and thus refuse to answer questions.  I'm going through fourty pages a day of C++ and I'm making them look like chumps for going so fricking rude to the people that haven't taken programming before.\r\n\r\nMoral of the story:\r\nDon't be egotistical claiming that you're a certified expert on everything otherwise someone's going to come in like a wrecking ball and make you look like a chump.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53a500b56368723917180000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"*Blends a kitten*\r\nwow\r\nsuch evil\r\nso edgy\r\nvery badass\r\nmuch hardcore","author":"50b70eeb7f123b1a02000097"},{"id":"53a5066c6368723ad2c50100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"Meanwhile in Tokyo\":http://www.amusingplanet.com/2011/07/portraits-of-squashed-commuters-in.html\r\nHow do they not suffocate to death, I don't know.","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"53a5071a6368723938ae0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Randomosaur\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53a500b56368723917180000#post_53a500b56368723917180000\r\n!http://1-media-cdn.foolz.us/ffuuka/board/m/image/1403/32/1403322705713.jpg!","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"53a507ac6368723820270300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SeraphimDawn\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53a5066c6368723ad2c50100#post_53a5066c6368723ad2c50100\r\n[bq=\"SeraphimDawn\"]\"Meanwhile in Tokyo\":http://www.amusingplanet.com/2011/07/portraits-of-squashed-commuters-in.html\r\nHow do they not suffocate to death, I don't know.[/bq]\r\nYou know; facebook's acquisition of oculus may be bullshit, but the one thing they did get right about how they want to bring work to your home is imagine never having to leave home to go to school or such.
