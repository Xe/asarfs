This is your fault that married is a dead!\"\r\n\"Fuck you conservatives!  This is your fault that the percentage of adults that are married is only 10%!\"\r\n\"fuck you!\"\r\n\"fuck you!\"\r\n\r\nIt's pretty safe to say that marriage is dying in the usa, not cause of <insert bullshit here> but rather congress keeps fucking up and taxing it to death.  If you wanted to promote people to marry you don't tax them more for marrying and having kids.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo the latest RVB video had a hilarious moment that is probably going to be under-rated.
