The Christian religion seems so divided on so many things that it feel like there's no sense trying to defend a viewpoint anymore.\r\nHell, we had a preacher one time go off the deep end and pretty much said, \"Everyone's going to Heaven! Nobody goes to Hell no matter what!\"[/bq]\r\nBefore we drop this subject I would like to present a theory:\r\nPurely hypothetically speaking probably something that helped Christianity gain popularity was assimilating pagan traditions, rituals and beliefs into it.\r\n\r\n\r\nPurely guessing here, but if the way Christianity gained popularity was through assimilating paganism with the current re-rise of paganism in western culture (1995 paganism only had 1000 members in the usa, now it has over a million so yeah it's gaining popularity) I would completely be 100% totally not surprised if the two to some level merge.  I don't mean as in they become one religion entirely, but rather like how Shintoism is often taught in conjunction with Buddhism.\r\n\r\nWhat I mean by this is that in the west at least personally what I think will happen is that yes Christianity will probably shrink drastically down to a billion and a half members, but at the same time paganism will grow drastically and they will share half of their believers.\r\n\r\nTl:dr; Christianity isn't dying, just shrinking a bit.  Paganism is making a comeback.  I would be totally not surprised if say by 2050 half of christians are pagans as well and half of pagans are christians as well.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"553464f36368723108cc1200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Carcass Strife\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/553464b363687261eb490500#post_553464b363687261eb490500\r\n~^He's a few meters, and from the side...
