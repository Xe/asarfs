What was slowing me down so much was that I was like a teddy bear when it came to body hair and it grew like a inch a month; sure for my scalp that's good and all but not good for my arms and legs.  I had to use a laser hair removal for a entire month everyday for it to start slowing down; now I only need to do it two days a week instead.  My facial hair may still be fuzzy, but at least it's no longer so thick that shaving would cause blisters.  Before on the scale of 1 to 10 on body hair I used to be chewbacca; now I'm about a 3.  It'll take a couple more months of laser hair removal to completely get rid of further growth, but it's definitely made a difference.\r\n\r\nMy voice sucks; it's going to take months to get a female sounding voice.\r\n\r\nMy butt is boney and I need to exercise.[/bq]\r\nMY BUTT IS SOFT AND BIG AND SQUISHY.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"552c61cf6368725f8d270b00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I'm the sexy blonde here","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"552c61df63687276b4bd0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/552c61be6368721b42b80400#post_552c61be6368721b42b80400\r\nSO IS MINE","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"552c620c63687250efd90200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/552c61df63687276b4bd0100#post_552c61df63687276b4bd0100\r\nBig butt buddies!","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"552c62196368725bbca21500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Background Pony #FDEE\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/552c608263687204ddcc0300#post_552c608263687204ddcc0300\r\nRun escape RUN!!!","author":"505696b47f123b37e800effa"},{"id":"552c62366368725bbce01500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Background Pony #FDEE\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/552c614263687243988f1600#post_552c614263687243988f1600\r\n\r\nwatt?","author":"37e5b9d66361642500af5e00"},{"id":"552c623f6368725bbcf71500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Also, I'm making oven fried chicken bitches!","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"552c62566368725bbc341600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/552c61cf6368725f8d270b00#post_552c61cf6368725f8d270b00\r\nAnd I'm the sexy black haired Asian.\r\nI called it!
