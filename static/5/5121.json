You either have to go the \"holy fuck!  How much money do you have?!\" route or the \"holy fuck!  How much free time do you have?!\" route cause there is no middle ground.  No wonder why the majority of transgender people illegally buy hormones because that's complete bullcrap that they won't even consider you for hormones until six months to a year after you've already began transitioning.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"551f03a4636872257ebf1300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/551f001763687263b7560200#post_551f001763687263b7560200\r\n[bq=\"trashboat\"]I gave up on torrenting Ultraman nexus.
