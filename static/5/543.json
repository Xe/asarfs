What I've found is that when you're at the point where you start thinking about yourself and what you lack too much, that's generally when it's the perfect time to go think about and do stuff for others.  Even if they never say or give gratitude, you'll start to get happier as they get happier, and you'll start to feel like you're belonging more and more.\r\nIt's a very slow process - I'm still trying to come to complete terms that I can help others and even at least get them to smile despite them never saying anything, but I'm getting it.\r\nPoint is, I can guarantee - at least from my perspective - that things will get better.  Sometimes a show of recognition or gratitude or someone laughing at your joke is all you need to keep going.  And if those signs don't appear, just hang on and keep at it, without smothering others' legitimate feelings and actively helping them out.","author":"4fde0c7e945b706cc30003eb"},{"id":"539f5a9c6368726a946e0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@ThatRandomGuy42\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/539f58ee6368726ba5840100#post_539f58ee6368726ba5840100\r\n\r\n\r\naw thats sweet.\r\n\r\n(this avatar still makes me look like a condescending bastard doesnt matter what i type, no wonder paska likes it)","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"539f5b0d6368726a94a60200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@CogWeaver\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/539f5a7f6368726cc53c0200#post_539f5a7f6368726cc53c0200\r\n\r\n\r\nit was a long time ago that happened, i dont feel im  failure, i mean i do pretty good in college, and those drepressed episodes last minimum like 2 hours, last one was in a month and the last one after that one was a year ago so its not that big of a problem, jsut gotta cope with it.\r\n\r\nmost of the depression only comes from the things already mentioned, not really feeling like im a failure at everything.\r\n\r\ni still dont know how to \"help\" people really, atleast on the internet, real life people are ok.","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"539f5be26368726a43a30200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://37.media.tumblr.com/117712c7c0601efbe653729de9f8646d/tumblr_mwc1etPhlx1rncec0o1_1280.png!\r\n\r\nrobby rotten is the most relatable character ever.","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"}]}
