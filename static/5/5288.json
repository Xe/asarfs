Essentially what is going to happen when Hillary becomes president is sure gay marriage will be legal and chances are weed will be legalized, *BUT* the usa will probably start to become _too_ socially liberal... as in more social topics that are socially controversial will probably be legalized as well.  I don't mean progressive ideology or such will become the norm or that progressives will get what they want; rather safe bets on what might be legalized are lower the drinking age (because self driving cars are already on the market and in say ten years human driving will probably be criminalized so the reason for the drinking age being 21 will be gone), gambling (around 60% of the usa is in favor of gambling), prostitution (it actually has higher support than you think) and incest (cause the majority of people in the usa actually support it surprisingly enough or they just don't give a damn so if there is a bill to legalize it there would be very little public opposition).\r\n\r\n\r\nTl:dr; Essentially the usa in 2024 won't be a \"progressive\" nation, rather it will be blackjack and hookers and weed.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"55287020636872762f600200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@HJSDGCE\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55286e6d636872747bbc0600#post_55286e6d636872747bbc0600\r\n\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55286f8e63687275b03e0300#post_55286f8e63687275b03e0300\r\nMe: sex= no comment ","author":"51a2815b7f123be59500049b"},{"id":"55287059636872494cf90000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Ore-O\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55286fdc636872494ccd0000#post_55286fdc636872494ccd0000\r\nShe was an annoying add-on that added nothing to the story.
