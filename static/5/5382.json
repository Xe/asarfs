The housing boom was artificial growth not natural economic growth.  When you get down to it economic booms that are followed by economic busts are due to artificial growth because of humans.  Well what happens if you increasingly remove humans from the economic decision making process?  To put it bluntly is the reason why we're not in a economic boom is because the computers in charge of wall street don't think like humans and therefore aren't creating artificial growth?  Is the worldwide economic stagnation right now due to because we're removing humans from the stock market and thus not generating artificial economic growth and that in reality the worldwide economic stagnation is due to actual economies and such?\r\n\r\nTl:dr; To use an analogy think of the world's economy as a Speed drug addict; they reached the point where they can't function without it but the second they no longer get that high they crash hard.  The difference now is that they're kicking the drug addiction and now their actual performance while it's not as high as when they were high is their natural performance levels.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"552da9bc636872424c611e00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I'm really interested in knowing the power levels of One-punch characters.
