A zombie game during the fall of civilization.\r\n\r\nIn zombie survival games or anything zombie always skips how it gets that way.  I think it would be interesting heading a army versus a regeneration type zombie.\r\n\r\nAt first the army is clearly winning and blowing up the zombies with grenades or such but as time goes on you start losing more and more men constantly and the zombies keep increasing in numbers so fast that it's just no possible to keep them down.  Like five minutes in one soldier in your battalion dies because he gets cocky thinking it would be easy; ten minutes in two more soldiers die cause they charged into a nest; fifteen minutes in the zombies just start exploding numbers wise; a hour later the zombies are in such large numbers that you're looking on the horizon and just seeing them as far as the eye can see.\r\n\r\n\r\nI remember reading a actual dissertation on a theoretical combat readiness of a army versus science fiction zombies and basically what it said that was traditional zombies would be no problem, but if it was something like the rage virus from 28 days later you're fucked because anything where the infection overtakes the host in less than 30 seconds the only viable solution would be to nuke the city to stop the outbreak because it would be impossible to get enough troops there fast enough to establish a quarantine zone.\r\n\r\n\r\nTl:dr; how to tell if a science fiction zombie in real life is a actual threat:\r\nDoes the infection overtake the host in less than 30 seconds?\r\nNo)Standard quarantine procedures are adequate.\r\nYes)Nuke the city cause by the time you physically get a army prepared and ready the outbreak will have already vastly extended beyond the quarantine perimeter.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"551c1a3b6368725e4c810d00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"And always remember children...\r\n!http://gelbooru.com//images/8a/b7/8ab761416ccd51f3e6ac046705469107.jpg?256047!","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"551c1c756368725ea4ee0800","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/551c1a3b6368725e4c810d00#post_551c1a3b6368725e4c810d00\r\nIndeed broken image links are very important,","author":"509f70a87f123b77eb0004fd"},{"id":"551c1c846368725e71dd0d00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/551c1a3b6368725e4c810d00#post_551c1a3b6368725e4c810d00\r\n403","author":"5007bbdf7f123b112f00023a"},{"id":"551c1f996368725f58d10400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Transparent image \r\n!http://36.media.tumblr.com/72d2d78bcae100ba4be3f007db9594a0/tumblr_nm3rr83emk1qbytw2o1_r4_540.png!","author":"51a2815b7f123be59500049b"},{"id":"551c20006368725f3c710600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Thanotos Omega\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/551c1c756368725ea4ee0800#post_551c1c756368725ea4ee0800\r\n\"@PaskaNaakka\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/551c1c846368725e71dd0d00#post_551c1c846368725e71dd0d00\r\nGoddammit.\r\n\"Here's the Dan link because Gel isn't working.\":http://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/132175?tags=yuusha_series+truth","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"551c20ba6368725e71811300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I'm gonna smack some bitches in this thread.
