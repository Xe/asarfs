bear with me for a second.\r\n\r\nWe can all agree that hollywood has completely ran out of reboot, sequel and remake films right?\r\nWe can all agree that hollywood for the most have no new ideas.\r\nAnime is mainstream in the usa even though mainstream media won't touch it with a ten foot pole.\r\nThere's been several recent announcements of hollywood making live action films based upon anime.\r\nThis means that hollywood realizes they've ran out of reboot, sequel and remake films and are trying to expand by remaking anime.\r\nThe reason why this is good is that there's a language barrier so western mass media can fuck up all their want and make as shitty films as they want and it won't translate into their source material.\r\n\r\nWhat I mean by this is that in say ten years instead of all those crappy quick buck movies that are remake of good movies that have been done to death or such chances are pretty good they'll turn anime shows and movies into live action western films.\r\n\r\n*suddenly imagines Nicolas Cage playing Father Alexander Anderson*","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5542aabe6368724140070000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5542a9e463687258935c1000#post_5542a9e463687258935c1000\r\nWell, there are some books or novels out there that deserve their movies too.\r\n\r\n","author":"5239db6da4c72d22d9000358"},{"id":"5542aba16368720dbaed0e00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I need to watch something random","author":"5239db6da4c72d22d9000358"},{"id":"5542ac356368720dbab50f00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Shadow the Hedgehog\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5542aabe6368724140070000#post_5542aabe6368724140070000\r\n[bq=\"Shadow the Hedgehog\"]\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5542a9e463687258935c1000#post_5542a9e463687258935c1000\r\nWell, there are some books or novels out there that deserve their movies too.\r\n\r\n[/bq]\r\nThe reason why I think it will be a good thing is look at godzilla '98;
