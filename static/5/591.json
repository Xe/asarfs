I am quite torn.[/bq]\r\nI'm probably going to get a ton of shit for this, but I'm with you on this.  I don't like pokemon.\r\n\r\nWhat I would like to see from a monster capture game is a combination of pokemon and digimon and add in a bit of real time battles to it.  What I mean by this is like how with digimon there's a couple basic baby digimon to which they then digivolve into a assortment of possible rookies to which then they have a wider assortment of champions and a even wider assortment of ultimates and megavolutions.  So only like one or two starters total to which they then evolve into say thirty possible tier two evolutions each then each of those can evolve into say three or so tier three evolutions each then two or so tier four evolutions.  It would make it so if you don't feel like going out and getting monsters by backtracking you can just raise the one you want.\r\n\r\nAlso real time environment battles.\r\nAnime:\r\n!http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/639/793/d61.gif!\r\nActual battles in the games:\r\n!http://25.media.tumblr.com/17d44e2a3da264785a406c796cadfee0/tumblr_mgb1pabo5c1r3ifxzo1_500.gif!\r\nThat's just straight up false advertisement guys.
