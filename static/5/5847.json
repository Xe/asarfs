Now this startled my thinking jelly. I jerked my head a near one-eighty. Apparently he had 'mated with the pretties', well 'raped the pretties'. And by pretties, I mean that unfortunate orange-furred ruffian. He posed tall above the reddened, whitened shredded character, with his *mumbles* knotty and pink, with a touch of snow.
