There are dudes who work with him that just give him whole legs and entire cuts of venison.

There, he meets Satan himself and strikes a deal. They will play a game and if he wins, he gets his life back but if he loses, he spends an extra 1000 years in Hell. Satan agrees to the terms and plays a very dangerous game involving a volcano and lots of dynamite.\r\n\r\nHe manages to beat Satan and as promised, he gets his life back, only to wake up during his funeral where everyone watched. Suddenly, Satan appeared and said that his castle was destroyed due to the game they played and now has no place to go until it's fixed.\r\n\r\nSo, he lives with that dude until the castle is rebuilt and they two have their own funny hijinks.[/bq]\r\nReposting because of reasons.\r\nAlso, imagine Satan with his really large build, red demon skin, goat legs and really big horns, living in your house just reading the newspaper and eating pancakes.\r\n\r\nAlso again, imagine him seeing demented people and going, \"Damn, humans are more fucked up than me. And I'm the embodiment of evil!\".","author":"4fe1b9f47f123b13df002976"},{"id":"553278c46368727889723b00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Number1pegasus\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5532787c63687236a8731300#post_5532787c63687236a8731300\r\nGo back to sleep.","author":"505696b47f123b37e800effa"},{"id":"553278e963687235871f1f00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Number1pegasus\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5532787c63687236a8731300#post_5532787c63687236a8731300\r\nMorning.\r\nI'm building stuffs.","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"553278f86368727f0ddc0a00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@igotnopicks\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/553278c46368727889723b00#post_553278c46368727889723b00\r\nFuck no! *Its time for ponies!*","author":"50c204917f123b31440000a5"},{"id":"5532791263687235980d1d00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Carcass Strife\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/553278e963687235871f1f00#post_553278e963687235871f1f00\r\n[spoiler]Inhale![/spoiler] ","author":"50c204917f123b31440000a5"},{"id":"5532792d6368727889373c00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I'm going to sleep, freaking time zones.","author":"4fdef063945b700a9d01604f"},{"id":"5532793f63687234bc540000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Welp, goodnight.\r\nSadly, no response for my manga Satan idea.","author":"4fe1b9f47f123b13df002976"},{"id":"5532797863687236a8be1400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Everybody strap in.\r\nThis episode's already wild.","author":"5201b5c0a4c72d0d9b0001e4"},{"id":"5532797c6368723598b01d00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"The yugioh mangas are a lot better than the show itself.
