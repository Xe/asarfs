It's possible that he harbored some pro-segregation beliefs early in life, but quickly changed his tune as he got older, writing about the equality of all men (expect probably Indians lololol) in journals and discussing it with his wife. But he couldn't say anything about it publicly, because saying you supported equality back in the 1800s would be political suicide. So he kept silent until he could be in a position to change things. The Civil War gave him the opportunity to release the Emancipation Proclamation under the guise of a \"military tactic\" (if all the slaves were trying to escape, or at least _knew_ that they could legally escape, there would be mass chaos in the South).\r\n\r\n...this was basically a watered down version of my essays.  \r\n\r\n\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/552db17c6368724fc0e20500#post_552db17c6368724fc0e20500\r\n\r\nDefinitely. \r\n\r\n\r\n\"@Gizoid101\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/552db2136368726ced1d0000#post_552db2136368726ced1d0000\r\n\r\nI think I read about this. Like I said in my above post, he didn't really have a choice unless he wanted to never hold public office ever again, not even as a postman. Whether this was right or not is up to argument...but I think it was probably for the best. -But I could very well be thinking of something else.-\r\n\r\nHe only got to speak his mind as president because he had such strong support from a strong group of powerful peoples, and even then, he tread carefully.","author":"5041b54f7f123b77af00a442"},{"id":"552db3506368726db8780100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@And Brother I Hurt People\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/552db2586368724fc0ea0600#post_552db2586368724fc0ea0600\r\nI'm going to assume you're correct since you actually studied it and I got my information from an article that I may have big even actually read. \r\n\r\nSo yay, respect for Lincoln has risen back!","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"552db3e0636872424c4a2d00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/552db3506368726db8780100#post_552db3506368726db8780100\r\n\r\nSo yeah, just know if anyone says that Lincoln only released slaves for political reasons, know they're full of shit. \"The North wanted slaves to be free!!\" is the elementary school version of history.

The north could transport troops around much more easily; they could manufacture their weapons much more easily, etc etc.  During the entire war the south's plan was to try to make the war last as long as possible to drag it out and constantly be on the defensive so as to reduce the north's advantage over them. . . needless to say the plan didn't work.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"}]}
