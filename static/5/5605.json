It was nothing too special just something I browsed the internet and did work on. Well one day I headed out to do something, I honestly don't remember what though. So I go and do the thing. I get home and my mom comes outside. And she's in tears. Like crying her fucking eyes out. So I ws thinking something really really bad had happened. So I run up to her worried as fuck and ask her what's wrong. And she starts apologizing profusely. Like over and over and over again. Through some shenanigans, my laptop got broken. And she was having a panic attack thinking I was gonna be mad about it. Obviously I wasn't. Because it was just a possession. It took me TWENTY minutes to get it through to her that I wasn't mad at her.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"5539dcfe63687261ba792000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"fuck\":http://thebuttkingpost.tumblr.com/","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"5539dd0663687269800b2c00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"In 3 hours, the result for the interview will be released.\r\nThen, I can either cry or _cry_.\r\n\r\nTwo different forms.","author":"4fe1b9f47f123b13df002976"},{"id":"5539dd4b63687269809a2c00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5539dce66368726976e12f00#post_5539dce66368726976e12f00\r\nAwwwwwwwwwwww~\r\n\r\nThat's adorable, You have a wonderful mom!
