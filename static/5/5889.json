Well he used Kriptonite, simple, but inteand of a rock, Batman used kriptonite dust, so when Superman accidentally inhaled it, all the dust entered in his lugs, making Superman falling sick And almost dying.\r\n\r\nSaitama is freaking poweful in planetary levels, but he is not a god and neither inmortal.

For the same reason; how many times has he gotten his ass kicked?  How many times has Bane broken his back again?  Why is The Dark Knight considered a modern day classic?  Cause it may not have been the best film ever, but because it was about two characters who would never give up no matter what.  If Heath Ledger hadn't of died then chances are there would currently be a bunch of Batman movies in the work that would be even better.\r\n\r\nWhat makes a good superhero film or series isn't about who has the most super powers but rather seeing the hero no matter how broken get back up.\r\n\r\nThat is why the Superman movie was utter shit is because the entire time they were talking about how Clark was going to change the world and how he would be a force for good and when he finally does become superman he blows up half of the city, kills hundreds of thousands of people and causes trillions of dollars in damage.\r\n\r\nWhat defines a hero isn't how many super powers he has, rather it's how he refuses to stay down.\r\n\r\n\r\nSide note: honestly I think superheroes that don't have any super powers or barely has any super powers are far more interesting than characters that have all the super powers.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"554848766368722656721d00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Shadow the Hedgehog\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55484790636872684c3b0400#post_55484790636872684c3b0400\r\nMy counter: Saitama normal punches are the equivalent of lazily throwing your arm with your hand in a fist.","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"554848aa636872684c950500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5548480f6368721ac4f02000#post_5548480f6368721ac4f02000\r\n[bq=\"uc9\"]What defines a hero isn't how many super powers he has, rather it's how he refuses to stay down.[/bq]\r\n...How do you not like One Piece again?\r\nThat's Luffy's Magnum Opus.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"554848ab63687212b2100300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Shadow the Hedgehog\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55484790636872684c3b0400#post_55484790636872684c3b0400\r\nWell, Saitama can just meet Batman and punch the entire neighbourhood away with the dude.\r\nEven Batman can't dodge that.","author":"4fe1b9f47f123b13df002976"},{"id":"554848f96368722face20700","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5548480f6368721ac4f02000#post_5548480f6368721ac4f02000\r\nSaitama may be practically god on a power standpoint, But The lack of challenge in pretty much all factors has left him almost emotionally dead.","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"554849256368722fac1b0800","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"If you want a more definitive example of what I mean:\r\nIf more superpowers = better character then why is the xmen wolverine's movie deadpool complete shit compared to regular deadpool?","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"554849506368725d6a131a00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/554848766368722656721d00#post_554848766368722656721d00\r\n[bq=\"trashboat\"]\"@Shadow the Hedgehog\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55484790636872684c3b0400#post_55484790636872684c3b0400\r\nMy counter: Saitama normal punches are the equivalent of lazily throwing your arm with your hand in a fist.[/bq]\r\nMy counter: Saitama eats something poisonus, gets tifoidea and dies.","author":"5239db6da4c72d22d9000358"},{"id":"5548498b63687201eaf30400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"The best friends are doing a playthrough of sonic adventure 1\r\n\r\nAt first I thought \"oh god more people I like shitting on one of the good sonic games\"\r\nBUT THEYRE TOTALLY INTO IT\r\nTHEY KNOW THE ADVENTURE SERIES IS HYPE\r\nI mean janky as hell but FUCKING HYPE","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"554849c0636872684c020700","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/554849256368722fac1b0800#post_554849256368722fac1b0800\r\nIt's not a point on which is a better character.\r\nIt's a point if both character were to fight, who would win.\r\n\r\nIn these kinds of situations, you throw away your fan-feelings, your general rooting for your favourite character and become the third party.
