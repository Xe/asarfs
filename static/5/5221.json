Basically the \"statistics\" were saying that people were just marrying at a older age when they were looking at a different generation all together; sort a statistical-centipede.  What they essentially did was that they looked at people born in the 1990's to look at marriage rates and then looked at people born in the 1980's to \"prove\" that people were just marrying at a older age when in reality marriages are continuing to drop.\r\n\r\nBasically what they did was how a dog throws up and then eats it's own throw up.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5524852a6368720b01490300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Number1pegasus\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5524834a6368726a7e3e0400#post_5524834a6368726a7e3e0400\r\n@YOU CAN'T DESTROY THEM ALL!@\r\n!http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--huVPtftt--/c_fit,fl_progressive,q_80,w_636/ah4i9dwtx1kcanrpwkf3.jpg!","author":"31bee2686368722a0df23600"},{"id":"5524856e6368722e7d1b2600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!https://41.media.tumblr.com/23618e61340d95f087d00a425449611c/tumblr_nm2lmfTEoV1qlgf30o9_540.png!\r\n!https://41.media.tumblr.com/7ca86434fddf385b1c4270d608ae80b3/tumblr_nm2lmfTEoV1qlgf30o1_540.png!\r\n!https://36.media.tumblr.com/cd949c968464242e96a34d6b9a915d2a/tumblr_nm2lmfTEoV1qlgf30o2_540.png!\r\n!https://40.media.tumblr.com/7ceeb7911b3b60d2a738c638cce1a8f7/tumblr_nm2lmfTEoV1qlgf30o5_540.png!\r\n!https://41.media.tumblr.com/58eabfda5d7700074653c06af84c6481/tumblr_nm2lmfTEoV1qlgf30o6_540.png!\r\n!https://40.media.tumblr.com/0875e6710e5fb6c5d1e865bb5fefc65d/tumblr_nm2lmfTEoV1qlgf30o8_400.png!!https://41.media.tumblr.com/352a9302bb89c44aebf04a1592d8d216/tumblr_nm2lmfTEoV1qlgf30o4_400.png!\r\n!https://40.media.tumblr.com/ea3f1e28b7fcfe0f955ff15f4d011c22/tumblr_nm2lmfTEoV1qlgf30o7_540.png!\r\n!https://40.media.tumblr.com/846817f83502a6784b6dc4eb176028f4/tumblr_nm2lmfTEoV1qlgf30o3_540.png!\r\n\r\n!https://40.media.tumblr.com/fba30826096b3d050bced2f847a8a44f/tumblr_nkl9zgf0zh1qjmob6o1_540.jpg!","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"5524857563687217a1c11300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"A part of me believes this is akin to getting the scale back on the balance.\r\n\r\nRemember back to the early 1900's how massive the birth rates were due to the need of factories to have employees on them to keep them functional. This trend still kept going until the early to mid 90's because it had become the social norm (You might notice how several families until those years tended to be from 4 to 5, even more children, if you happen to have a ton of uncles and cousins) but it slowly began to die away due to technology advancing and pretty much every work now (or at least in the near future) can be done without the need of man labor, so there's no need to have kids anymore out of a social need but rather out of wanting it, thus creating a decaying effect, because as \"@Whatevs\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/552483f663687217a19e1200#post_552483f663687217a19e1200 and \"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/552483016368724109160200#post_552483016368724109160200 said, tastes and who people want to spend their lifes with has changed to the point is harder to pick someone who fills our standards.","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"552485986368722a77900f00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5524850963687237a1c70900#post_5524850963687237a1c70900\r\nHeh","author":"4fe16df67f123b13e400003f"},{"id":"552486756368722a30710000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Gizoid101\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5524852a6368720b01490300#post_5524852a6368720b01490300\r\nGod Dammit!
