Seriously; in the over a decade of Voldemort being dead there was only a handful of still active death eaters that knew of the hocruxes and was still trying to bring him back.  Even if it took them years to find hocruxes and destroy them that would still be either all of them gone or enough that gone that Voldemort when revived would be forced into hiding to prevent anymore from being destroyed.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53a4efc96368723ab0d00100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53a4ef696368723bc9670100#post_53a4ef696368723bc9670100\r\nAnd I'm sorry, retconning Harry's dad into a dick for the soul purpose of appeasing Snape fangirls is the dumbest shit I've ever seen.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"53a4f0486368723b7ac50100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53a4ef696368723bc9670100#post_53a4ef696368723bc9670100\r\n\r\nThe problem amounts to this. I'm not against a villain whose tries to go against the concept of Death. \r\n\r\nBut why did Voldemort chose such special objects to hide his soul?!
