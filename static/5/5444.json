For those of you that have played Kerbal Space Program have you ever been in one of those situations where your space craft has barely enough fuel left and so you try one last maneuver to try to get the spacecraft to slingshot the moon or a planet so that it will instead orbit it instead?

Regardless of what you think about the law the Republicans playing chicken with the country's economy for a single law is not fucking cool.  If you have a problem with a law you fix it and don't risk defaulting the entire fucking country cause of it.  I do agree that parts of it need to be fixed, but how the usa government almost defaulted would have been considerably worse.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5532c3226368720cbbe60700","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Chili or Pizza?","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"}]}
