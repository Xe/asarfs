Basically what happens is the tissue surrounding the bite starts dying. And the deas tissue will just grow and grow and grow and preventing healing until it actually affects your blood-flow. Then you die. In the past and even some parts of the world today necrosis is treated with maggots. The maggots will devour the dead tissue and leave the living tissue intact.  Allowing healing to take place.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"5535ebed6368721c96ee0700","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Is it strange that i prefer places with a bit of run-down buildings and general decrepitude to completely clean and respectable places?
