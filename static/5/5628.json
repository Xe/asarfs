I \"got it\" the first time, and I didn't need to rewatch FLCL. All I needed to do was surrender myself to the madness, and I enjoyed every moment of watching it.\r\n\r\nFLCL does seem pretty much like a really bizzare metaphor for growing up. And I do think it's pretty much like Seinfeld - _a show about nothing_. That is, if you could make such a comparison. The point is that FLCL is unconventional as hell, and you are a fool thinking you can just get it. Even I still don't get it somewhat, but I don't care, because I just had fun going insane watching it!\r\n\r\nDon't watch FLCL to just \"get it\". Watch FLCL for FLCL.","author":"536f7a11636872666e2d0000"},{"id":"553b08816368725d02861600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@ToskiHero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/553b083a6368725660a60f00#post_553b083a6368725660a60f00\r\nFLCL/Seinfeld crossover _now_.","author":"5201b5c0a4c72d0d9b0001e4"},{"id":"553b08a86368720cdcdb2400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@toxicrystal\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/553b08816368725d02861600#post_553b08816368725d02861600\r\n\r\n!https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/star-wars-the-force-awakens-memes-01-seinfeld-george-costanza-lightsaber.jpg?w=650!","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"553b08f06368725660b01000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@toxicrystal\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/553b08816368725d02861600#post_553b08816368725d02861600\r\nYOU FOOL YOU HAVE DOOMED US ALL!!!","author":"505696b47f123b37e800effa"},{"id":"553b0941636872246afa0a00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Sure Yusei.
