When made properly, it is simply very strong alcohol with a very hard taste, or \"kick,\" because it hasn't been aged. It is usually very potent, as high as 150 proof, which is about 75 percent alcohol. That high alcohol content can be pretty dangerous in itself; but again, the biggest problem is that there aren't any regulations to make sure that it's made properly.\r\nSome distillers realized that part of the appeal of moonshine was that \"kick.\" They experimented with different ingredients to add more kick to the drink, including manure, embalming fluid, bleach, rubbing alcohol and even paint thinner. Many of these ingredients are extremely poisonous, and many people died from drinking it.","author":"37e5b9d66361642500af5e00"},{"id":"553a69416368723b0b9f2b00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Kaz\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/553a68c663687277acc13700#post_553a68c663687277acc13700\r\nYeah that sounds about right","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"553a699063687220630f0500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/553a69416368723b0b9f2b00#post_553a69416368723b0b9f2b00\r\n[bq=\"Too_Offensive\"]\"@Kaz\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/553a68c663687277acc13700#post_553a68c663687277acc13700\r\nYeah that sounds about right[/bq]\r\n\r\nMy oc usually drinks moonshine outta flask at night to knock herself out (she has severe insomnia)","author":"37e5b9d66361642500af5e00"},{"id":"553a6c0163687275a8691000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"You ever have one of those days where you REALLY didn't want to put on clothes?","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"553a6c7b6368723694070d00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/553a6c0163687275a8691000#post_553a6c0163687275a8691000\r\n\r\nNein","author":"37e5b9d66361642500af5e00"},{"id":"553a6cb96368726958360200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Kaz\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/553a6c7b6368723694070d00#post_553a6c7b6368723694070d00\r\n[bq=\"Kaz\"]\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/553a6c0163687275a8691000#post_553a6c0163687275a8691000\r\n\r\nNein[/bq]\r\nYou should try it, it's fun","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"553a6ce46368723694980d00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Kaz\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/553a6c7b6368723694070d00#post_553a6c7b6368723694070d00\r\nReally?
