The reason why I say it's okay to call me a asshole here is cause think about it people have become to believe that reproducing is their fundamental right and it's pretty much become you're almost certain to reproduce.  It doesn't matter if you're a abusive asshole that beats your spouse if they try to leave you're definitively going to reproduce because it's become you're \"right\" to reproduce.\r\n\r\nThink about it for a second; if say 50% of the population never reproduces and those that do try to reproduce have to compete to reproduce do you think abusive assholes are nearly going to be as successful at doing so?\r\n\r\n\r\nProblem currently with society on the topic of reproduction:\r\n\"You dumb *******!  I deserve to reproduce!  What are you going to do?  Find someone else?  If you leave me you'll be forever alone\"\r\nIf there is a drastic decrease in marriages:\r\n\"You dumb *******!  You have to choose me over that nice person!  If you don't choose to reproduce with me I'll fucking bash your knees in cause it's my right to reproduce!  I deserve to reproduce so if you choose that nice person over me I'll fucking slice you!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI don't see how such a drastic decrease in marriages is a bad thing when A)asian immigration is increasing and probably offset the population decrease and B)if there is such a drastic decrease in usa born people marrying usa born citizens or such it'll push abusive spouses or other undesirables completely out of the genepool.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhatevs may be ideologically biased, but he does make good points once in a while.  He pointed out to me that people are marrying immigrants more and more people are dating people outside the usa and them moving to the usa more because people are sick of dating \"undesirables\" from home.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"55248dd06368720826f40800","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@EHAN\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55248d556368723fcff20600#post_55248d556368723fcff20600\r\n\r\nYou're all europeans, that's weird enough","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"55248dfc6368727e5ffe0300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/552488ef6368726a7e530700#post_552488ef6368726a7e530700\r\nwell, remember that French Canada has been hard to assimilate into greater canada.
