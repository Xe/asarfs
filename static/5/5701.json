And because you're constantly getting rid of cards getting to your trump card is easy. Although if a duel went on for more than ten turns you were basically fucked. But by the time you git Lightsworn Dragon on the field you had between five to ten monsters in the graveyard, all with \"Lightsworn\" in their name. That meant Lightsworn Dragon would get a MASSIVE power boost on top of his still impressive 2000 atk points.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"553ea68863687263a08b0f00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Number1pegasus\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/553ea5d86368726c606b0d00#post_553ea5d86368726c606b0d00\r\nThe Yu-Gi-Oh World Tournament games and Spectrobes.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"553ea6c36368726c60a80e00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Number1pegasus\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/553ea6126368726c60bb0d00#post_553ea6126368726c60bb0d00\r\nWill do\r\n\r\nOnce I find something appropriately weird to pose him with\r\n\r\nMaybe I can find my sigmund Freud action figure...","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"553ea7aa63687206b2071d00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"God I sound like a bigger nerd than usual right now...","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"553ea7e363687257126a0c00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/553ea7aa63687206b2071d00#post_553ea7aa63687206b2071d00\r\nNah","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"553ea8326368721f74630a00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/553ea6c36368726c60a80e00#post_553ea6c36368726c60a80e00\r\nDo et!\r\n\r\n\r\n\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/553ea7aa63687206b2071d00#post_553ea7aa63687206b2071d00\r\nNo, You sound like your having fun.
