Art teachers are probably why I'm uncertain about everything.  \r\n\r\nMy art teacher is like a hawk when it comes to making mistakes. _Extremely_ meticulous. \r\n\r\nWe do personal projects, which are due every three weeks. When we complete them, my teacher will dig into each individual piece of art like a grave robber. Heck, he can go on for an entire period just explaining how just one of my classmate's paintings can be improved. \r\n\r\nHe especially goes after me for the misplacement of colors and values. He's not mean or anything, he just has that calm, bedtime story voice. I usually bring a small pillow I made back in middle school to class for cushioning on my arms, but on the days he does critiques, I feel like laying down on it and catching up on the sleep I missed the previous night. Not out of disrespect, because I try my hardest to stay awake. Darn insomnia.
