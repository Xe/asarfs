Essentially if in a hypothetical you could delete a person's personal memories without damaging their ability to function they would be a completely different person; or vise versa if you were to hypothetically erase a person's persona they would be a completely different person.  These two interacting with each other is essentially what makes a person unique; even if you were to copy a person's persona without their memories as well they would still be a completely different person.\r\n\r\nGhost in the shell touched on this by what they called \"ghost dubbing\" in which you overwrote a person's memories and their persona to effectively copy yourself even though you were still alive.\r\n\r\nAnyway; the reason why I bring this up is that looking at past controversies where people are pushed to the extreme sides you see people willingly neglecting their own individual beliefs, memories and their personality for the sake of \"a greater good\".  Essentially they're intentionally forcing themselves to lose their individuality for the sake of furthering their cause even if they know their cause is wrong or false or factually incorrect or such.\r\n\r\nLet's go back to ghost in the shell for a second; what I mean by this is that hypothetically if that was true you would see fanatics intentionally overwriting their \"ghosts\" to become a \"true believer\" of the cause.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"55260b16636872357d680600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Gizoid101\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55260816636872352e670700#post_55260816636872352e670700\r\nOh boy, opinions, those are always a recipe for chaos.
