I've never really suffered for my oddities. I've always been loved and I've never really been bullied at all. Although strictly speaking, I'm still in the closet to everyone except my best friend and my mom. But they're the only people IRL whose opinion I really care about anyway. \r\n\r\nAlso if the cure was used as Capitol punishment for crimes like necrophillia, child molestation, rape or snuff how would you feel about that? \r\n\r\nI feel like it would be crossing a moral line to force it as punishment. As an option to lighten the sentence maybe but if it's not consented to, the authorities would be forcibly  changing the thoughts and feelings of a human being. Which is terrifying.
