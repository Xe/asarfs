Easy; right now both houses of congress are controlled by republicans.  The general rule of thumb for presidents is that unless something drastic happens after 2 years they essentially become more concerned with keeping their party electable.  By the time Democrats gain a super majority of both houses it will already be time for the next presidential election.\r\n\r\nTl:dr; in 2016 I'm not voting for a liberal; rather I'm voting for a congress that by the time they gain enough seats for pushing ideology it'll already be time for the next election.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5531d3166368724b74b61800","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Retracted","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"5531d3516368721fb0580e00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5531d3136368721fb0160e00#post_5531d3136368721fb0160e00\r\nI'm voting for whoever displeases people I dislike.
