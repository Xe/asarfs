Microsoft isn't making a version of linux; rather they're making a windows version more like linux and less bulky and more secure.\r\n\r\nBasically you know how windows as time has gone on has become complete shit?  *cough* windows xp was the greatest windows operating system of all time *cough* Basically they're cutting out all the useless crap from windows for the sake of making smaller, faster, safer cause linux is being used more and more for servers so in order for microsoft to not slip into getting their butt kicked in the long run they're making windows more into like linux.\r\n\r\nEssentially: they saw that people hated windows vista and windows 8 and they're actually listening to the complaints.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"55282cf7636872211dcf0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"His name.
