It requires a certain amount of self awareness to know when you are making an actual character instead of a self insert/wish fulfillment character. \r\n\r\nThere is also a degree of over saturation to consider.

I did, and I am properly ashamed.\r\n\r\nI'd like you to meet Hex:\r\n!http://th00.deviantart.net/fs5/PRE/i/2005/130/3/c/Wall_of_Murder_by_gasmaskangel.jpg!\r\n\r\nThis is an OC of mine from way back in 2005 (I was 16 at the time).
