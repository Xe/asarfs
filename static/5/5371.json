Granted, I never ripped off another kid's ear but still. And ame is basically what I fantasized about being as a kid. I wanted to be something else and go on adventures and shit (I blame american dragon and digimon frontier)\r\nPlus my mom has super powers. \r\n\r\nThat stuff (and a couple of other things I'd rather not bring up) are the reason I think this movie hit me so hard. I related to it _a lot_. I think it would have still hit me pretty hard even without that suff though. I just think I wouldn't currently still be crying. Like, maybe I'd have stopped about 15 minutes ago. \r\n^-also thank you for showing this movie because I really enjoyed it or whatever-^\r\n[/bq]\r\n\r\nalso\r\n!https://cdn.weasyl.com/static/media/ff/f8/56/fff856bf6d5907b9534af50b69ac75da6c75498726791208281bfe73be78e1f7.png!","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"552d36e16368723c93f31800","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Kinda wished Yuki and Souhei kissed :L","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"552d36e56368724009640e00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/552d357a6368723c93421500#post_552d357a6368723c93421500\r\nGlad I could share this amazing amazing movie.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"552d37726368727ab7dd0900","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/552d36e56368724009640e00#post_552d36e56368724009640e00\r\nGlad I watched it.
