That's not really a controversial statement, I don't think.\r\nAs such while I doubt it will fall apart it has always struck me as being in a fluctuating state of entropy at all times.\r\nBorders are probably going to be rewritten but I doubt the big players will be gone any time soon.\r\n\r\nI would like to see the Saudis go but they'll probably be their own undoing.\r\nBecause they keep trying to foment people like ISIS with their oil money to destabilize nearby rivals.\r\nThis is a huge problem because it is affecting their own people too... And the problem with ISIS and the House of Saud is the House of Saud are not real caliphs and would be killed if an islamic state movement took over.\r\nThey can't have this both ways, something is going to break eventually.","author":"4fe16df67f123b13e400003f"},{"id":"553760096368720736122f00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Whatevs\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55375dd0636872219be51500#post_55375dd0636872219be51500\r\nIf you ask me playing with ISIS is like playing Russian Roulette and passing it back and forth until someone does blow their head off.  On the one hand their progress into Iraq is slowing down, but in other regions militias and terrorist groups are pledging allegiance to them.
