He is the leader of a faction called The Nights of the Blackened Denarious, a group of humans who have taken up the 30 silver coins that Judas was paid in and work with the fallen angels imprisoned within to do nothing but spread evil and darkness across the land.\r\n\r\nHe works as both a tempter since these fallen angels grant terrible power to those who take up the coins and as a direct threat through a combination of competence, ruthlessness and being utterly, batshit EVIL.\r\n\r\nAnd yet he's charming. He banters well, cares for his daughter and is operating out of genuine belief in his utterly monstrous cause.\r\n\r\nHe isn't some dupe you can feel sorry for, he's not a bad boy with an interestingly lost soul that needs redeeming, he is a complete and utter monster and yet he is an utterly fascinating one.","author":"4f41ee04945b701c41002af7"},{"id":"539e7947636872045a330600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@gasmaskangel\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/539e78d7636872045a540500#post_539e78d7636872045a540500\r\nthere was a quote I thought you would like but I forgot.\r\n\r\nSo here is this one, \"never underestimate the predictability of stupidity.\"","author":"4fe16df67f123b13e400003f"},{"id":"539e79ee6368724547120000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"*Steals bacon from GMA's fridge*","author":"50b70eeb7f123b1a02000097"},{"id":"539e79f26368724536300000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Whatevs\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/539e7947636872045a330600#post_539e7947636872045a330600\r\nWas it \"no one ever lost money betting on the stupidity of the American public?\"","author":"4f41ee04945b701c41002af7"},{"id":"539e7a3363687242570d0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@gasmaskangel\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/539e79f26368724536300000#post_539e79f26368724536300000\r\nnah","author":"4fe16df67f123b13e400003f"},{"id":"539e7a9f63687242ac280000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"never underestimate the power of stupid things in large numbers","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"539e7bb46368724536a60000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Randomosaur\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/539e79ee6368724547120000#post_539e79ee6368724547120000\r\n\r\n*Takes the bacon of Random*","author":"31bee2686368722a0df23600"},{"id":"539e7c67636872439eba0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Gizoid101\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/539e7bb46368724536a60000#post_539e7bb46368724536a60000\r\n*Eats Gizoid and the bacon*","author":"50b70eeb7f123b1a02000097"},{"id":"539e7c84636872439ec60000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://25.media.tumblr.com/171b67b84c57847a2864c6ba3df75dc4/tumblr_mjj9he7wLh1rouw9co1_500.gif!","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"539e7ca66368724385b10000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Randomosaur\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/539e7c67636872439eba0000#post_539e7c67636872439eba0000\r\n\r\n*Gizoid eats the bacon inside Random*","author":"31bee2686368722a0df23600"},{"id":"539e7d0b6368724589e60000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Gizoid101\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/539e7ca66368724385b10000#post_539e7ca66368724385b10000\r\n*A tapeshark living inside my stomach rips Gizoid's stomach open and puts the bacon back in my stomach*","author":"50b70eeb7f123b1a02000097"},{"id":"539e7e226368724257fe0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Randomosaur\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/539e7d0b6368724589e60000#post_539e7d0b6368724589e60000\r\n\r\n*Gizoid attacks and eats tapeshark.
