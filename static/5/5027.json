In the beginning of the new era when the age of machines begun, the Universal Culture saw daylight on earth. Ignorant of their own actions, humans built culture like ants and so all the preparations have already been made.

On the atomic level we are truly immortal and ageless beings. Age is a relative phenomenon, and in The Universal Culture, I'm Zawahal, a space marine only at the age of 27. The Universal Culture is already here. \r\n\r\nalso, bread:\r\n!http://oppiminen.yle.fi/sites/oppiminen.yle.fi/files/uploads/reikaleipa2.jpg!","author":"5007bbdf7f123b112f00023a"},{"id":"551877cb6368721c30e30400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Yay the new Page for One Punch man is out!
