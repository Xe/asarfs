To put it simple a left libertarian 100% supports most liberal beliefs but lacks the liberal faith in an enlightened government.\r\n\r\nPersonally I'm a fuck it libertarian. I basically believe that people should just leave eachother the hell alone and stop trying to run eachother's lives both civilly and financially. However this is just my rational belief. Off the cuff I tend towards left libertarianism because that is where my heart lies, but when my intellect catches up I tend to regret my gut reactions.\r\n\r\n\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55289d9e6368724ae7261000#post_55289d9e6368724ae7261000\r\nSo can you help me move then?

Essentially the majority of people in the usa are anti-authoritarian and the only reason why both parties take opposing views on social issues is that it benefits both of them to draw distinction between each other.  The problem with this is that if a new party comes onto the scene with the ideology of anti-authoritarianism that accepts both sides of the political spectrum our two party system may come under attack.\r\n\r\nEssentially if a new party comes onto the scene opposing both the republican and democratic party but promoting anti-authoritarianism they may become the new kid of the block.\r\n\r\nTl:dr; we may see a new political party come about because both republicans and democrats have been so utterly ignoring anti-authoritarians even though the majority of voters are anti-authoritarian and chances are if that does happen either one of either republican party or democrat party or potentially both may be forced into extinction.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5528a07b6368722844f11c00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55289dc963687235a9371300#post_55289dc963687235a9371300\r\nFreaky, yet that looks awesome.
