Fuck no dude; if anything you should feel great that you did so well against so many people.\r\n\r\nIf you still feel like shit then get a pell grant or a fafsa loan; they'll be enough to cover your college expenses if you did well enough.  Back when I first started college I had the same problem of being rejected by every scholarship, but I had a meeting for fafsa and the response I got was \"why are you upset about this?  Of course we're going to give you a fafsa loan cause you may not have been valedictorian but if they only ever gave out grants and loans for valedictorians then there wouldn't be any doctors in the country and people would be dying of diseases on the street cause nobody would know how to treat illnesses\".\r\n\r\nYou may not be 1st place, or 10th place or even 100th place but just cause you're not doesn't mean you can't get grants or such.  If they only ever gave grants to whoever gets 1st place then the world would literally fall the fuck apart.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"551eb8e8636872781b7d0d00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://i.giphy.com/LaY6rTfnLOaFG.gif!","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"551eb94b636872781bf30d00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Im having a bad day...","author":"51a2815b7f123be59500049b"},{"id":"551eb9d8636872793bcf0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SidewardManatee\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/551eb94b636872781bf30d00#post_551eb94b636872781bf30d00\r\nLook at pictures of cats.","author":"505696b47f123b37e800effa"},{"id":"551eba5063687278e64c0600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/551eb8e8636872781b7d0d00#post_551eb8e8636872781b7d0d00\r\n!img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130603045025/tf2console/images/d/db/Tf2_sniper_icon.png!\r\n_not fuh long wanka_","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"551eba6b63687278b5bc0800","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SidewardManatee\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/551eb94b636872781bf30d00#post_551eb94b636872781bf30d00\r\nSay \"bubbles\" as angrily as you possibly can","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"551ebaa263687276846c2e00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/551eba6b63687278b5bc0800#post_551eba6b63687278b5bc0800\r\nHelping her out is getting exhausting...","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"551ebb53636872781b891000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/551eba6b63687278b5bc0800#post_551eba6b63687278b5bc0800\r\nI wish\r\n\r\n\r\n\"@igotnopicks\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/551eb9d8636872793bcf0200#post_551eb9d8636872793bcf0200\r\nNo","author":"51a2815b7f123be59500049b"},{"id":"551ebb68636872781ba51000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/551ebaa263687276846c2e00#post_551ebaa263687276846c2e00\r\nWhat's going on?
