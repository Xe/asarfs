She won't watch anime/manga/superhero films or play video games.  She won't even watch Ultron.\r\n\r\nShe grew up in the era when people legitimately believed stuff like DnD was satanic rituals or such.\r\n\r\nGive me a definitive homerun introduction movie, book, game or such to get someone to try other stuff; something that is definitively across the board regardless of whether or not someone is a part of it's fandom definitively agrees will get someone into geek culture.  I don't mean your favorite manga or anime, but something regardless of whether or not you're a fan of you can definitively agree that everyone will enjoy.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5546975e6368723bebb20000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@HeroInferno\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5546956e6368720ad78c0300#post_5546956e6368720ad78c0300\r\nI _think_ next Saturday there's going to be a special of some other show so MLP is going to be airing the Saturday after that. \r\n\r\n","author":"50c204917f123b31440000a5"},{"id":"554699fb6368723bd5620300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/554696f96368723bd54e0000#post_554696f96368723bd54e0000\r\nWhat kind of genre of media does she usually like?","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"55469add6368723b36930500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SeraphimDawn\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/554699fb6368723bd5620300#post_554699fb6368723bd5620300\r\nShe likes movies and she seems to like video games but she doesn't seem to have the long term patience to play long games.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"55469eb76368723b365e0b00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"There are parents that likes videogames?\r\nI didn't know that kind of species exist.","author":"5239db6da4c72d22d9000358"},{"id":"55469ec36368723b47c90a00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Yu Yu Hakusho episode 15\r\n[spoiler]Kurama's rose whip.[/spoiler]","author":"505696b47f123b37e800effa"},{"id":"55469f666368723bc7ec0900","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55469add6368723b36930500#post_55469add6368723b36930500\r\nJust like me...","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"55469f9f6368723b47df0b00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"So.
