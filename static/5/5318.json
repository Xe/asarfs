I'm not talking about pseudo philosophical franchises where the topics are never discussed by the main characters, but rather I'm watching Innocence right now and their discussion on how humans desire to mechanize themselves to escape nature's limitations on their bodies and by proxy death is fairly relevant in that the gynoids are ghost dubbed in order to make them more human by doing so you're essentially creating a living puppet; not biologically alive but still alive nonetheless because puppets are hyperidealized representations of humans.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5529e23d6368722004f50300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"OH MY GOD YOU GUYS\r\n!i.imgur.com/mtrLTLu.png!\r\n\r\n\r\n\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5529e1616368723bb4a60700#post_5529e1616368723bb4a60700\r\n\"Bad rats\":store.steampowered.com/app/34900/","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"5529e26c6368720c0c730500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5529e23d6368722004f50300#post_5529e23d6368722004f50300\r\n*PREPARE YOURSELF FOR THE WOOLIE WORLD* ","author":"50c204917f123b31440000a5"},{"id":"5529e28b6368723bb4880900","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Number1pegasus\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5529e26c6368720c0c730500#post_5529e26c6368720c0c730500\r\nWatch out for Woolie Holes","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"5529e28d6368720c0ca70500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5529e23d6368722004f50300#post_5529e23d6368722004f50300\r\nI'd buy that.
