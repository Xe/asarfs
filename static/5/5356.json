What was slowing me down so much was that I was like a teddy bear when it came to body hair and it grew like a inch a month; sure for my scalp that's good and all but not good for my arms and legs.  I had to use a laser hair removal for a entire month everyday for it to start slowing down; now I only need to do it two days a week instead.  My facial hair may still be fuzzy, but at least it's no longer so thick that shaving would cause blisters.  Before on the scale of 1 to 10 on body hair I used to be chewbacca; now I'm about a 3.  It'll take a couple more months of laser hair removal to completely get rid of further growth, but it's definitely made a difference.\r\n\r\nMy voice sucks; it's going to take months to get a female sounding voice.\r\n\r\nMy butt is boney and I need to exercise.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"552c600e63687276b4330000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Hello. what is going on here?","author":null},{"id":"552c60506368725bbc051300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Background Pony #FDEE\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/552c600e63687276b4330000#post_552c600e63687276b4330000\r\nTalking about body hair.\r\n\r\nuc9: *chewbaca noises*","author":"4fe1b9f47f123b13df002976"},{"id":"552c605463687250ef570100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Background Pony #FDEE\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/552c600e63687276b4330000#post_552c600e63687276b4330000\r\n\r\nWHOA A NEW PERSON :D hiii","author":"37e5b9d66361642500af5e00"},{"id":"552c60616368724398881500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Background Pony #FDEE\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/552c600e63687276b4330000#post_552c600e63687276b4330000\r\nIt's a thread about nothing.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"552c608263687204ddcc0300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Kaz\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/552c605463687250ef570100#post_552c605463687250ef570100\r\nI am a nu person, or am I?","author":null},{"id":"552c60b56368725f8d930900","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Background Pony #FDEE\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/552c608263687204ddcc0300#post_552c608263687204ddcc0300\r\nThe fact that you spelled that wrong on purpose is obvious that you've been here before.","author":"4fe1b9f47f123b13df002976"},{"id":"552c60c16368722666200c00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/552c5f7963687204dd900200#post_552c5f7963687204dd900200\r\n@UH, HOW MUCH IS THAT LASER HAIR REMOVAL?@\r\n\r\n\"@Background Pony #FDEE\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/552c608263687204ddcc0300#post_552c608263687204ddcc0300\r\n@HI KAZ@","author":"31bee2686368722a0df23600"},{"id":"552c60fe63687276b4fa0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Hello new person I'm the resident science nerd and political nerd.
