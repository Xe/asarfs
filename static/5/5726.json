A lot of people were talking shit about the 2014 Redesign of Godzilla. Saying he was \"Too fat\" or \"to blubbery\" or his legs were too short and chunky. In short, he's very bottom heavy. Wouldn't an animal that big NEED short strong stocky legs to support it's own body weight? I mean he's *300 feet tall.* And another thing people don't consider is the face. In the new Godzilla movie Big G did something he's never truly been able to do, EMOTE. Old Godzilla relied primarily on body language.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"}]}
