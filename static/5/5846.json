Wake up.\", Mordecai complained as he bent down by Rigby's trampoline. He grabbed the raccoon by the shoulders and began shaking him. \r\n\"Ugh... Wha- What time is it?\", the scraggily mammal mumbled slurred as if he just downed a whole bottle of vodka.\r\n\"10 A.M dude!\"\r\nRigby rubbed his eyes,  (he made a very half-assed effort to keep them open) and then yawned, which he seemed to over-exaggerate.\r\n\"But it's Saturday\", Rigby replied  with a whine in his voice.\r\nThunder rumbled outside making Rigby's eyes shoot wide open.\r\n\"Shit!\", Mordecai hissed, \"he shuffled to the window and peered through the metal blinds. He saw that the sky had turned dark gray, although it was sunny when he had awakened about 8:00. Despite the fact a storm was obviously brewing there was only a slight breeze. They were supposed to meet Margaret and Eileen at an amusement park (which had a name that had a lot a thought and effort put into coming up with... 'Le Park de Amusement').\r\n\"We're supposed to meet Margaret and Eileen at the amusement park today, dude. At 11:30.\", the blue jay said annoyed \"But, I guess we can't since it's about to storm... Sigh, I'll call Margaret and ask her if she wants to see a movie or something with Eileen instead... Go back to sleep if you want.\", he then said downtrodden.\r\n\"Thanks.\", he fell back asleep in an instant. Mordecai took his cell off his nightstand and shuffled out of the bedroom shutting the door behind him.\r\nStanding outside the door, Mordecai dialed Margaret's number then held the phone to his 'ear'.\r\n\"Hey, Margaret.\", he cooed, \"Umm... I was wondering if you and Eileen wanted to see a movie instead since it seems like it's gonna storm. Maybe Mt.KILLimanjaro 2?\" \r\n\"Sure, Mordecai! What time?\", she said with her usual happy tone; hearing her voice made him blush.\r\n\"I dunno, how does 2 'o' clock sound? The movie, I think, starts at 3:15, so we could get lunch first or somethin'.\"\r\n\"Alrighty!\", she exclaimed.\r\n\"O.K I'll be by 1:45 to pick you guys up, See ya.\", Mordecai replied.\r\n\"O.K, see ya later.\"\r\nMordecai closed his phone and reentered back the bedroom and plopped down onto his bed.\r\n\"We're going to the movies and lunch in a few hours instead, 'K' dude?\"... Mordecai looked over at Rigby and began to laugh hysterically, \"Wonder what kinda dream you're having!\".\r\nThe raccoon awakened to the sound of the bird's laughter. \"What are you looking at?\", Rigby said snobbishly to Mordecai catching sight of him as he rubbed his eyes; he now was sitting up.\r\nRigby's dream ((\"Oh, Mordo. I love you so much!\", he said cuddling the jay with his scrawny arms around his waist as they lay in Mordecai's bed; everything around them was nothing, but white and void. \"Kiss me, Rigby.\", the jay said seductively. As soon as their (maw and beak?) touched he woke up.))\r\n\"Dude I feel so bad for that jacket you frenched in your sleep.\", he said snickering.\r\n\"Wha-... Aw, sick!\", he replied in disgust and threw the slobbered jacket at the bird. The jacket landed by his feet and the jay began to laugh hysterically once again.\r\n\"Dude what the hell...\", Mordecai asked trying to contain himself,\"Seriously... Phew...\".\r\nRigby could only pout and frown at him.\r\n\"Who or what were you dreaming of?\", Mordecai asked. \r\n\"Uhhh... Ummm... Eileen. Yeah, Eileen. That's who!\", Rigby said hastily. Mordecai sat on his bed and looked at Rigby... He studied ever facial expression he made. He knew Rigby was lying... He could tell. \"You're lying.\"\r\n\"Nuh-uh!\"\r\n\"Uh-huh...\"\r\n\"Stop talking!\", Rigby snapped back.\r\n\"Whatever, dude.\", Mordecai sighed shaking his head... \"Want me to make you breakfast or something.\"\r\n\"Sure. I guess\", Rigby said coldly.\r\n\"Alright I'll call you when It's ready.\" He then walked out of the room. Rigby groaned, lied down, shut his eyes, and decided to ponder on about what the hell he had just dreamt, but he ended up falling asleep instead.\r\nMordecai arrived at the kitchen, which was empty, and walked to the fridge. Upon opening it, he found a Tupperware container containing the pepperoni pizza from last night (Why it was in a container like that, I dunno) and placed it on the counter. The jay pried open the container and obtained a cold slice.[/spoiler]","author":"37e5b9d66361642500af5e00"},{"id":"5546454d6368727d71640200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"*yawn*","author":"51a2815b7f123be59500049b"}]}
