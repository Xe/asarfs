It's believed that the mythology of succubus started during the dark ages due to sexual repression; essentially the people who were sexually repressed had sex dreams about demons and they told others that \"the devil was trying to sway everyone\" and as a result more and more people had sex dreams about succubus because they believed it.\r\n\r\nThat would be a evil and genius way for a religion nowadays to gain ground; start a equivalent large scale rumor saying that <insert your religious mythological creature> was giving people sex in their sleep meaning that they were chosen to prophet to the people -> that person tells everyone -> other people have sex dreams -> they tell others -> religion spreads like wildfire.\r\n\r\nIt would especially work in areas that still believe in that sort of thing.  Just start a rumor, spread it all over and constantly and a couple weeks later the entire area is converted.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5540820963687271125f0b00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55407f966368724be2a60c00#post_55407f966368724be2a60c00\r\nWhat about tha God of -Adorable- Destruction?\r\n!http://simg4.gelbooru.com//images/d6/75/d675a2f9d97a4f77dda4b48870ca41bc.png!","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"554082eb6368724fbf994b00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5540820963687271125f0b00#post_5540820963687271125f0b00\r\nIt would probably have to be a god of fertility or such though.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"554083a96368724fbf354d00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5540820963687271125f0b00#post_5540820963687271125f0b00\r\nEEEE","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"554083ae6368724fbf414d00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/554082eb6368724fbf994b00#post_554082eb6368724fbf994b00\r\nWell....I mean...to some...Beerus may as well be...","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"554084d96368727f58901b00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"question:\r\nwhich of these browns in combination with this yellow looks the most like hair and the least like turds?\r\n!http://i869.photobucket.com/albums/ab259/potatosoup/Mobile%20Uploads/image_zpsxozmtbej.jpg!
