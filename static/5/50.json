Make a single map game zombie game that only takes 30 minutes to complete(minus all the dying) and make it dark souls level difficult.  The zombies can smell you and are tracking you down; you're being hunted and not the other way around; also if you kill a zombie the zombie loses bowel control and the zombies can smell that resulting in them knowing you killed one and will result in them fanning out and systematically searching for you; one hit deaths cause they will be smashing your skull into concrete, ripping your head off or ramming you into woodchippers that way no one can complain about it \"not being realistic\" cause in real life if you were rammed into a woodchipper I think you would be dead too.\r\n\"@Number1pegasus\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53196bbb6368727957fc0000#post_53196bbb6368727957fc0000\r\nPretty much.
