Their reason being is that all the early elections have resulted in next to no tea party members actually succeeding in getting re-elected, which posses a problem for a party that wants to get re-elected.  So huzzah the tea party won't have a single member getting elected in 2014 cause now not only do they have zero chance of getting re-elected they now have to deal with the people who rain money down on them like a bank raining money down to ceo's now all piling on them to beat the living shit out of them before they cost the republican party anymore seats.\r\n\r\nTl:dr; Old school republicans with the money grew a brain and are now beating the living shit out of the tea party and dragging them out of the caucuses minus a few teeth to prevent the tea party from costing them anymore seats.\r\n\r\nIn other words:  Congratulations republicans you finally get your party back from the people that have been shitting on it for the last six years.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"531e645a6368727650820300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Whatevs\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/531e63c46368722d415c0100#post_531e63c46368722d415c0100\r\n\r\nThat's about what I thought.
