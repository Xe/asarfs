Turns out yeah this will probably happen sooner.  I found out about the \"singularity summit\" which actually talks about this.  The actually estimates are anywhere from 2017 to 2112.  There's a 10% chance by 2028, a 50% chance by 2050 and a 90% chance by 2112.\r\n\r\nThe top three predictions are by kurzwell places it as before 2050, vinge places it as before 2030 and stuart armstrong as somewhere around 2040.\r\n\r\nI'm going to have to go with vinge on this one.  The reason being is simple; businesses want human level intelligence ai to run their businesses that are preprogrammed with the know how of all of economics and such to have record high profit.  The problem with that is that programming something to control a entire business internationally all the way from the bottom of handling groceries to the top of investment without fail would be fucking hard.  Imagine it; programming something 100% line by line every little bit to handle every operation of a business without missing a beat.  Imagine how long that's going to take.\r\n\r\nThe military wants skynet, but they want a skynet that is 100% completely coded by humans that they can control without fail and without it ever making a mistake.  The problem with that is without how chaotic and unpredictable the battlefield can be making a ai that can 100% ensure 100% of the time no accidental friendly fire.\r\n\r\nAcademia just wants grant money.  My money is on someone using the blue brain project's research to do so.  If it's them that's first we don't really have anything to worry about.  The reason being is that their goal is basically a artificial human brain, not skynet.  Less skynet and more ghost in the shell.  Less T-100 and more tachikoma.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"}]}
