Truth be told, no one in my family had ever taken a loan except for my bro.

Cause a lot of the wars in the middle east are proxy wars.  If you have the countries responsible for the proxy wars under your thumb then shit's going to calm down eventually.  I'm totally aware that both sides are complete assholes responsible for war crimes and shit, but if you have both of them financially dependant on you then they're not going to be so eager to start shit if it means potentially losing your money.\r\n\r\nDo I think all wars in the middle east will immediately end and everyone will be singing and holding hands while skipping through fields of flowers?  No.\r\nDo I think the current wars will immediately end?  No.\r\n\r\nRather what I think will happen in the next decade is that there won't be more than one or two new wars and that over the next decade the current wars will start winding down... Except for Syria; Syria is fucked.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"551ec081636872781b051700","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/551ebd536368727916470600#post_551ebd536368727916470600\r\nPoor Syrians.","author":"4fe1b9f47f123b13df002976"},{"id":"551ec294636872781b1e1a00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@HJSDGCE\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/551ec081636872781b051700#post_551ec081636872781b051700\r\nDo I think there will ever be a day where there will never ever be another war until the heat death of the universe?
