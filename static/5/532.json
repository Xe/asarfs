I quite laught in some parts, [spoiler]like the fat guy being smashed by an aircraft and Cage being killed by a truck[/spoiler]. The concept of \"reseting the same day over and over again\" reminds me to a certain movies, like Souce Code and Groundhog Day. Also I find very interesting that you have that power and see the faces of the people after telling them what will going to happen in a short future or know everything about them (family, where you born, your name, etc).\r\n\r\nBut what intrigues me most of the movie, [spoiler]was that the General Brigham knew in the beginning that Cage will \"save\" the world, because he will get the loop thing in the future.[/spoiler] I am not sure if was just coincidence or not, but in the ending, everything goes normal [spoiler]because Cage never been stripped of his rank. What I mean is, the Brigham's plan was select Cage, if he refuses, then his rank will be stripped, send to the battlefield, and die so many times until kill the Omega, and the Omega will make contact with Cage and reset everything, so the new Cage could do the work more easily.[/spoiler]\r\n\r\nThis movie was a little confusing, and the ending was meh, but still.","author":"31bee2686368722a0df23600"},{"id":"539e3d196368726dbe780200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Gizoid101\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/539e3ca56368723681e70500#post_539e3ca56368723681e70500\r\nAll I know about that movie is what I read in the Light Novel.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"539e3d96636872357c640100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"We need to ponify this.\":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uNuDkDorIg \r\n\r\nI don't know if Luna or Discord should be in Lucifer's role though.","author":"50b70eeb7f123b1a02000097"},{"id":"539e3ebd636872243bca0600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Randomosaur\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/539e3d96636872357c640100#post_539e3d96636872357c640100\r\n\r\n\r\n\"he took atleast 3 wifes: mary, martha and joseph smith\"\r\n\r\njoseph smith is best waifu.","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"539e3fcc63687205701d0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/539e3d196368726dbe780200#post_539e3d196368726dbe780200\r\n\r\nWell, imagine that the general knows since the beginning that the protagonist will be the hero, but the protagonist doesn't want because is a crap in the battlefield, so the general send him to fight with a large group of soldiers, so any one of them will encounter with a monster that can loop time. One of those soldiers, aka the protagonist, get that loop power, became a super soldier after dying a lot and kill the brain of all aliens. But the brain auto-loop and the super soldier, aka protagonist, returns at the beginning of everything. And now, with the protagonist being a super soldier, he meets again with the general and agrees with him because he is now a super soldier.\r\n\r\n!http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NcpapFpuMW8/URAC-sidZuI/AAAAAAAAAB0/auTRQvHhCTU/s1600/Mind-Blown.jpg!","author":"31bee2686368722a0df23600"},{"id":"539e422b6368720565d10000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I
