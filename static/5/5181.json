While on the surface this sounds good the usa no longer has a stable birth rate and the only reason why we're still growing is due to immigration.  If it wasn't for immigration the usa would be currently up shitter creek without a paddle.\r\nThe second scenario can be presented by using japan as a analogy; even though japanese culture vilifies crossdressing, mtf and such otakus are the majority of the younger generations and a lot of otakus in real life prefer traps over born female individuals.\r\n\r\n\r\nBasically what I'm getting at is that in a purely hypothetical scenario but if we ever reach the point where it's considered socially unacceptable for women to act in a feminine manner I would not be surprised if birth rates in the usa just crash into oblivion instantly.\r\n\r\n\r\nTl:dr; if that ever happened:\r\n24/7 news, \"Congratulations!

It's going to take another 20 to 30 years until the majority of the workforce is mechanized.\r\n\r\nIn a purely hypothetical scenario to illustrate my point let's say that today people in the usa stopped having sex:\r\n2016: \"It's not a problem; there's nothing wrong and we're all okay\"\r\n2025: \"OH GOD!
