I was involved in a to-the-death game show.\r\n\r\nThe first game was a two-vs-two shooting that acts a bit like laser tag but uses special guns that shoot 4 different elements and wearing colour-changing suits. The suits will change colour from time to time and in order to harm the enemy, you have to use the right element at the corresponding colour. Using the wrong one deals no damage.\r\n\r\nThe second game was an arcade-like game. Inside a glass box is a spinning monkey head and on another box was a knob-like object that kept going up and down. The trick is to stop the monkey head at the right time so that it would face you. To stop it, you have to either push or pull the moving knob, in the opposite direction. Failure means you get hit by a virus and die. Also turn into a zombie.\r\n\r\nThe third game was a map-trekking game. But you have to stay on the path because outside the path is radioactive plants that emit high levels of radiation. The path sometimes break apart from time to time, forcing you to cross the radioactive areas to reach the end. It felt so painful due to the internal bleeding and organ failure.","author":"4fe1b9f47f123b13df002976"},{"id":"552329896368726f6eda1800","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55232949636872080cf80000#post_55232949636872080cf80000\r\nSteal it.","author":"505696b47f123b37e800effa"},{"id":"552329ea63687270d2240100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@igotnopicks\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/552329896368726f6eda1800#post_552329896368726f6eda1800\r\n!i.ytimg.com/vi/nRJcoC1i4gY/hqdefault.jpg!\r\n*AND NO ONE WILL EVER KNOW*","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"55232a3263687243002d0500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Just think\r\n\r\nThere are people on the internet who've never experienced \"this\":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WgT9gy4zQA","author":"9ba2e84e636164642cc03200"},{"id":"55232a66636872732a341200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@QuasarNova\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5523293c6368727422bc0d00#post_5523293c6368727422bc0d00\r\n\"Here is the webtoon.
