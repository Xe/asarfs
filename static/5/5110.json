The whole tulpa thing has the potential to be interesting, but the community has done a good job of giving it a . . . bizarre name, and to a degree the group reflected that itself. There was a lot of internal strife over what was appropriate conceptually, and some people put more thought into it than others.

It's basically an imaginary construct that is given a hallucinated form through lots of practice visualizing it. People have taken it a step further in some ways by trying to give tulpas personalities, trying to achieve \"conversations\" with them, etc. From what I've seen it seems like it is similar, in some ways, to writing a character for a story, in that you have to be intimately familiar with what the tulpa's motivations are so that you know, naturally, how it would respond to a situation.\r\n\r\nSupposedly with enough practice it creates what is basically a beefed-up imaginary friend. It seems that only a small portion of the community sees it as an opportunity to implement a sort of mental tool rather than a way to facilitate fantasies, of whatever sort, with their favorite characters, or characters derived from them.","author":null},{"id":"551e20bd6368724a8d632d00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@EHAN\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/551e202b6368724bedb51700#post_551e202b6368724bedb51700\r\nAw, yiss.\r\nHard candies are the best.","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"551e20f06368724cbd370800","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@hype\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/551e1f396368724c19361200#post_551e1f396368724c19361200\r\nWell he does have confidence, that's for sure.","author":null},{"id":"551e218c6368723ffd000000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"We Love Russia 2015 - Russian Fail Compilation #31\":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uovyzHnWSio","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"551e22226368724a8df82f00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Background Pony #8391\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/551e20f06368724cbd370800#post_551e20f06368724cbd370800\r\ni suppose\r\n\r\nyknow you should hunker down in here, it's basically an anime thread so youd love it","author":"50a843d47f123b2e7c001359"},{"id":"551e22576368724bedf31a00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@hype\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/551e22226368724a8df82f00#post_551e22226368724a8df82f00\r\nNo thanks, got plenty of people pestering me about that stuff already.","author":null},{"id":"551e23896368724ad6b02e00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Background Pony #8391\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/551e22576368724bedf31a00#post_551e22576368724bedf31a00\r\nyou say that almost as if you don't like it","author":"50a843d47f123b2e7c001359"},{"id":"551e239a6368724bedce1c00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SeraphimDawn\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/551e218c6368723ffd000000#post_551e218c6368723ffd000000\r\nChicken be like\r\n\"U wot, m8?\"","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"551e25146368724d37db0700","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"We Love Russia 2015 - Russian Fail Compilation #32\":https://youtu.be/nTBUbvGfniU\r\n\r\n\r\n\"@Carcass Strife\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/551e239a6368724bedce1c00#post_551e239a6368724bedce1c00\r\nI think that was a turkey.\r\nAlso, that cat doesn't seem to give a f-k even though it was on top of a hood of a moving car.","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"551e258c6368724b50eb2700","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SeraphimDawn\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/551e25146368724d37db0700#post_551e25146368724d37db0700\r\nI've never heard of a white turkey.\r\n\r\n\"This guy has some bad luck with a soccer ball.\":https://youtube.com/watch?v=8F9jXYOH2c0\r\nAnd I swear to god, if we start an argument about the sport's name.","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"551e273e6368724bed0d2200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Watching Black Lagoon now, I have no idea what to expect, I did absolutely no prior research\r\n\r\nAnd I'm pleasantly surprised with a solid anime so far\r\n\r\nIt reminds me of Bebop except... not in space and not in the future\r\n\r\nPlus one of the characters has the same voice as Gilda... and acts sorta like Gilda... yet she's a much better Gilda than Gilda","author":"9ba2e84e636164642cc03200"},{"id":"551e27a06368724defdb0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@EHAN\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/551e273e6368724bed0d2200#post_551e273e6368724bed0d2200\r\nYou're talking about Revy?\r\nYeah, now imagine Sonata talking like Revy.
