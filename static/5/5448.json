Cause it's super easy to gauge how popular something is going to be from the popularity backlash in that the more popularity backlash there is from something you know it's going to become popular.\r\n\r\nThe popularity backlash from monster girls almost directly mirrors the popularity backlash of when nekos first came onto the scene and not only that but monster girl popularity while still considerably smaller is still comparable to neko.\r\n\r\nTo further expand upon this when nekos first showed up it was a quick way to earn money because it was something new and interesting so as a result any show that had any neko characters received a definitive popularity and monetary boost, but fast forward today it's reached the point at which popularity wise it's actually considered the norm for at least one neko character or such to be in fantasy style anime or such.\r\n\r\nWhen monster musume gets it's anime it's completely fair to say that because the number of monster girls in anime currently is disproportionately low to how popular it is that it will receive a disproportionately high number of views even among people that have never been interested in the franchise will watch it.  This will in turn cause other companies to create their shows with monster girls and such thus giving rise to their widespread adoption in anime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEssentially: monster girls are becoming popular, but they don't get nearly any tread in anime.  When monster musume airs it will probably be in the top 5 most watched anime for 2015; other companies will introduce monster girls or create their own anime about monster girls as such to try to cash out as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nTl:dr; in 2 years monster girls will be as popular as and in as many shows as neko.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5532e2316368722498220300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Number1pegasus\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5532e1e863687264f6431800#post_5532e1e863687264f6431800\r\nFucking Florida","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"5532e27c636872796b8f1200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5532e22f636872796b3f1200#post_5532e22f636872796b3f1200\r\nI will be okay with this","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"}]}
