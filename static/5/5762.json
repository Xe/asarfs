The weapon modifications don't do ridiculous things like make the bullet shoot faster or such, but are for reduced recoil and most of the mods are for non-standard firearms.\r\n\r\nThe most unrealistic things in it are the medkits, anti-radiation medicine and the anomalies.\r\n\r\n\r\n. . . Simply put: you're going to die a lot in the games even on easy mode cause if you get shot with a higher caliber bullet even if your armor can withstand the impact it's going to take a huge chunk off your health.  It's totally possible to die in one shot if you take a shotgun to the face cause you ran up to enemies like a dumbass.  Enemies will actually try to flank you and will take cover and most of the time will throw a grenade into a corridor before entering it.  If you're waiting for enemies to run into a corridor so you can machine gun sandwich them then chances are instead they will have gone the other way and blow your head off from behind cause rather than entering the hallway they walked to back entrance and flanked you.\r\n\r\n\r\nShort version: it's the anti-call of duty and it's a game for masochists.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"55419909636872730fff0800","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/554198ac63687220faa70200#post_554198ac63687220faa70200\r\nI need this game.","author":"5201b5c0a4c72d0d9b0001e4"},{"id":"554199256368722ae5fe0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55419780636872730fb70600#post_55419780636872730fb70600\r\n...Why the most rarest shit must happen in Australia?\r\n\r\n\r\n\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55419789636872457f0b0000#post_55419789636872457f0b0000\r\n[bq=\"SquiggyBomb\"]\"@Shadow the Hedgehog\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5541969e6368721e8c340000#post_5541969e6368721e8c340000\r\nSpiders aren't ugly!
