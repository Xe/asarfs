You start as a superhuman badass with super awesome gear, but as the game wears on you get exhausted and wounded, your gear breaks and you have to substitute whatever you can find while the brutality of the game just gets ramped up and up, thats the basic idea of the article. I was wondering what sort of story would work with that and I've come up with a few things.\r\n\r\nThe first is the morality play. Whether they intend to or not every story has a moral, its just something built into the very act of storytelling, but the morality play is special in that the moral infuses every single aspect of the story. The moral here is that power is a corrupting, dehumanizing force. The greater the power, the harder it is for the individual possessing the power to relate to those they has power over, partially because of the \"the people look like ants from up here\" perspective, and partially because when you talk to someone with a gun on some level everything you do and say to that person will revolve around the gun. The story would begin on a grand scale, a fight against the forces of Evil(tm) and draw closer and more personal as the power is decreased.\r\n\r\nThe other idea is a brutal hardcore game that starts out challenging and just gets worse. Where you face off against a final boss with a health bar bigger than Jesus and a dozen bullshit instant kill attacks just so you can say \"I fucking did it!\" when you finally manage to take it down to Chinatown for a good ole fashioned curb stomping.\r\n\r\nThe third is a bit like the first, it begins with the power fantasy deconstruction, going from facing an impersonal force of tyranny because it makes your balls feel big, down to a more personal level of ugly emotions and vulnerability and then a realization that you shouldn't fight Evil(tm) because it makes you a hero or feel like a badass, but because it is right to stand up to cruelty and tyranny, and after this realization you start gaining levels again.
