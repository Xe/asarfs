What I mean by this is that is all those manufacturing jobs are starting to come back to the states not cause of anything anyone really did, but cause robotic assembly lines have made it to where it's starting to be more expensive to manufacture things and china plus the cost to ship it and so forth.  For example what's going to happen to all those Foxconn workers since Foxconn is actually debating whether or not to go to the usa cause they're planning on replacing the vast majority of their workers with robots.\r\n\r\nThe net good robotics brings about is good, but I still recognize that's a lot of jobs lost in the process.  Like I have no doubt that such moves will in turn help the global economy on a net pro vs con way(I've been up for thirty hours shut up; can't think of the term for this), but still a lot of people are going to lose their jobs.\r\n\r\nFor example a lot of minimum wage jobs within the next ten years are looking at being replaced with robots cause they're getting to the point where it's just cheaper to have a robot janitor; while the net good is still positive in that drives down costs thus lowering costs all around that's still a lot of jobs gone.\r\n\r\nIt's going to be interesting to see though; my guess is on the vast majority of the shit jobs in the world will be gone in say thirty years, but on the plus side no one will have to break their backs working 16 hours a day in a farm anymore, but on the downside a lot of people are going to get fired.\r\n\r\nThe question is what is this going to look like?  What is going to happen to all those fired manufacturing workers once the usa pulls the plug on the manufacturing and they're all replaced with robots?\r\n\r\nUnlike most technocrats I do actually recognize that industrialization does actually hurt a lot of people and not everything brought about it is good, but that doesn't mean that it's not worth it.  Like just cause I hate oil doesn't mean I don't recognize that it *was* a necessity for all the countries to industrialize, but I still recognize the harm it does.  A lot of technologies are like this; not squeeky clean, not absolute evil.  A example of this that I go on about often is how cybernetics is being worked on; when that comes about a fuck ton of doctors are going to lose their jobs cause \"Organs dying?  Augments.  Lose a leg?  Augments.  Old?  Augments.  Paralyzed?  Augments.\"  Actually I remember the scifi show ghost in the shell actually had a episode about this in which traditional organ transplants could not compete monetarily and thus monetarily forced tons of people who didn't want it to get cybernetics.\r\n\r\nA lot of people at the end of the day will be monetarily forced to go with the flow regardless of whether they want to and will have the choice of adapting and accepting new technologies that come out or choose to die.  Is this evil?  No; it's economics.  I'm pretty sure no one would call a doctor evil for treating sick people.\r\n\r\nI guess my point is that the needs of the many outweight the needs of the few or the ones in that yeah it sucks that a lot of people will lose their jobs in say farming as things like synthesized food or such become reality, but would you really look at the faces of billions of people and say to their face \"I believe you deserve to die to preserve my moral superiority\"?  Like seriously; if there was a button that would kill a billion people but at the same time preserve your morals would you press it?  No; I'm totally being serious here: if there was a button that as soon as you pressed it a billion men, women and children would drop dead but you would preserve your morality being \"right\" would you press it?  Think of something you believe in; if you pressed the button you could preserve that morality as \"right\" for all eternity, but at the cost of a billion lives. . . would you press it?  (Personally there is no way in hell I would ever press that button cause I'm not the sort of person to strive to preserve my views as \"right\" at the expense of others)","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53a5a80363687242fbf10000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Anybody watching the 24 Hours of Nurburgring?","author":null},{"id":"53a5ad24636872431a2e0300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Background Pony #291B\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53a5a80363687242fbf10000#post_53a5a80363687242fbf10000\r\n\r\n\r\nwuzzat","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"53a5c4b46368723c77960000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53a5526d63687241b7510200#post_53a5526d63687241b7510200\r\nwhat the read did i just fuck","author":"5007bbdf7f123b112f00023a"},{"id":"53a5c9886368721a991d0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Zennistrad\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53a5616163687246cc920000#post_53a5616163687246cc920000\r\nI'd press for the most epic world ever...\r\n\r\nplus I'd probably actually have a life.","author":"505385287f123b1f30000849"},{"id":"53a5c99a6368721c484f0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!https://31.media.tumblr.com/e0582d28c27e442c252be3686ec38631/tumblr_n2oy4gCMZi1sks3jco1_400.gif!\r\n!https://38.media.tumblr.com/0d15e05e38722538c03d40aa8776cc0b/tumblr_n2oy4gCMZi1sks3jco2_400.gif!","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"53a5cba16368721b0ad20000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@PaskaNaakka\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53a5c4b46368723c77960000#post_53a5c4b46368723c77960000\r\nWoof","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"53a5d1e66368721df3120300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"my skin is falling off","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"53a5d4606368721d4bc10400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@twistedmetalero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53a5d1e66368721df3120300#post_53a5d1e66368721df3120300\r\nSunburn?","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"53a5d4766368721dffba0400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53a5d4606368721d4bc10400#post_53a5d4606368721d4bc10400\r\n\r\na late one.","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"53a5d8f763687210876d0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"Sunrise apparently made an ultraman anime in the same year they made Mobile Suit gundam\":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYb5m2qW6jA","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"53a5daee63687211a3e70000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53a5d8f763687210876d0000#post_53a5d8f763687210876d0000\r\nMan, I feel young.","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"53a5e2026368721257a50300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"What console s this?\":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0-NdIcjmCE","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"53a5ed096368721c5a0f0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Zennistrad\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53a5616163687246cc920000#post_53a5616163687246cc920000\r\nI like ponies but I hate Pokemon.
