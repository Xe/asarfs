Fun. And good writing. Basically in One Piece I legitimately care about the characters I'm supposed to care about. And One Piece isn't as rigid in it's setting. Oda has set up One Piece where virtually anything can happen and it makes sense. Remember, this is a series in which a Rubber Man regularly converses with a reindeer who is also a doctor, a speedo wearing cyborg, and a skeleton with an afro.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"5537375b6368723bc5220800","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"We've got to find out -what- *who* D really is\r\n\r\n[spoiler]!http://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2014/09/D4-IGN-6-720x405.jpg![/spoiler]","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"553738956368723bc54b0a00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5537371e6368722f45680200#post_5537371e6368722f45680200\r\nHmmm.
