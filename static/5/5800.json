At first I understand cuz they were doing bills.\r\n\r\nBut what happened was my brother went to go ask to use the car which they said ok.\r\n\r\nBut than we found out the road we usually take is closed so my Uncle (He lives here too) offered to take us since we don't know other routs.\r\n\r\nWe sort of think its not needed so we just found a rote online. So I told my brother that we should go early to make sure we get there. \r\n\r\nAll of a sudden my Uncle takes the car without warning and we're like \"Uhhhh, What?\" and so my brother goes and asked our Grandma what happened and she didn't know.\r\n\r\nSo than my brother calls our uncle to which he replies \"I forgot to pay my phone bill\"...Which is something you can do with your phone.\r\n\r\nAnd than he replies \"This might take an hour or less\" the movie starts at 1:30.\r\n\r\nAnd by the way he literally just offered to take us not even a minute ago so he knew we were about to get going. \r\n\r\nAnd than he says he's going to drop off at McDonalds. And its like Dude, We literally said we were about to go. \r\n\r\nAND we don't know what we're doing because of the rout change.
