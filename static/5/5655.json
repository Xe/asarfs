It could probably be the best mod out there if everything else on the unused axis is invisible indestructible blocks and also it would drastically reduce lag.  So like the x and y axis you can only travel and the z axis you legitimately can not move into cause it's invisible bedrock.\r\n\r\nWhy would it reduce lag?  Easy the more complex machinery or blocks there are in minecraft the more lag there is.  Even if you have a absolute shit computer if you plugged in the mod with say direwolf 20 modpack since you're only using things along one plane everything is distributed greatly.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"553c55766368727161111100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/553c533b636872430f680400#post_553c533b636872430f680400\r\nAnime sounds really weird ( and funny) when you have no context.\r\n\r\nIs this what its like when I prattle about comics?
