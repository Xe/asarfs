Essentially a person starts from the idea of say \"I want to be good\" (that's a axiom) and base their morals off that.\r\n\r\nMe on the other hand my two axioms are the ideas of \"strive to not physically harm others\" and \"the biological necessities in order to survive of multiple individuals are of higher importance than luxuries of a solitary individual\", but beyond that I don't have any \"morals\" to speak of.  If someone were to go \"Hit me!\" I'd hit them with everything I got and I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy it.  I lie all the fucking time if it's for promoting a person's well being or such, cause in my mind if you're lying to help someone get their food at the end of the day then what's so \"wrong\" about that?  I'll admit that I've straight up stolen, not anything really valuable just like clothes or blankets or cans of food that nobody wants from people's clothes closets that they never wear (what's minus one tshirt out of a hundred from a hoarder's closet?), for someone that needed it from someone that wouldn't miss it and would just write it off as having lost it.
