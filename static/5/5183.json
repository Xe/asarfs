Hypothetically if there was a alien race *THAT* smart it would be 100% forbidden to fuck with entropy because even if you were to \"slightly\" change it you would instantly kill every last organic lifeform in the entire universe by causing it's cells to boil from the inside thus turning all life in the universe into a instant fire.\r\n\r\nOr better yet why not change the speed of light?!  Sure you'd create a particle of infinite energy and as a result any matter the light particle interacts with would cause a chain reaction destroying all matter in the known universe.\r\n\r\nOr better yet why not change gravity?  Sure you'd instantly collapse all matter in the universe in on itself, but why not?\r\n\r\nOr strong nuclear force or weak nuclear force?
