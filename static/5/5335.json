But interesting. Okay, Daredevil and She-Hulk. Matthew Murdock and Jessica Walters. What is the two things these two have in common? They're both active superheroes and they are both LAWYERS. Murdock being a defense attorney and Walters being a prosecutor, I believe. How about a Daredevil/She-Hulk crossover comic where instead of fighting it out in the street, Murdock and Walters battle it out IN COURT. Murdock defending his client and going out in the guise of Daredevil to find evidence of his or her innocence while Walters works to prove them guilty. I think it could work as a four or five issue story too.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"552b3dfe6368722607e51a00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/552b3db16368727063081100#post_552b3db16368727063081100\r\nSounds like super hero Phoenix Wright","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"552b3e296368722424824900","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/552b3db16368727063081100#post_552b3db16368727063081100\r\n*@DC STEALS SQUIGGY IDEA@*","author":"31bee2686368722a0df23600"},{"id":"552b3e3a6368727edc8a0a00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Gizoid101\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/552b3d7e6368727063b41000#post_552b3d7e6368727063b41000\r\nI can't anyway.","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"552b3e516368722424d14900","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Fat Gotenks!","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"552b3e88636872754d201700","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/552b3db16368727063081100#post_552b3db16368727063081100\r\n\r\n!https://retconpunchdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/screen-shot-2014-10-28-at-5-39-18-am.png!\r\n\r\n","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"552b3eab63687226070e1c00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/552b3db16368727063081100#post_552b3db16368727063081100\r\n\r\n\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/552b3dfe6368722607e51a00#post_552b3dfe6368722607e51a00\r\n*ACE ATTORNEY FEATURING SHE-HULK AND MURDOCK FROM THE MARVEL SERIES*","author":"50c204917f123b31440000a5"},{"id":"552b3edc6368720b6f3a1100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@QuasarNova\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/552b3e88636872754d201700#post_552b3e88636872754d201700\r\nThat's the street.

A technocrat is the exact opposite of a luddite and I totally admit that technocrats often are seen as religiously devoted to furthering science and are often seen as religiously reverent about scientific advancement to the point we're often seen more as a religion than a ideology.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyway the article in question was more of a opinion article.  The article posited that 100% organic human beings will be extinct by 2050 because simply put traditional medicine can't keep up with demands so people are trying to mechanize the human body instead.  To put it simply by 2020 the world's first prosthetic olympics will be held and it will be more of a nascar race of sorts between companies to show off their latest high performance models.  As time goes on more and more non-amputee individuals will undergo surgery to replace limbs with prosthetic ones, the military will -force- \"suggest\" soldiers to receive prosthetic limbs and organs so as to give them a edge.  We have the startings of artificial organs already being in the experimental phase.  Basically to shorten it by 2030 everything except your brain will be mechanical.  Around 2040 you'll start seeing neural augmentations and replacements for specific parts of the brain with it's uses expanding.  Around 2050 if everyone has replaced not only their limbs, but their heart, lungs, liver, their face and gone so far as to replace their brain completely is the \"human race\" still a thing?\r\n\r\nIf you replace a person's arms, legs, lungs, liver, heart, face and brain with mechanical ones are they still \"human\"?\r\n\r\nThe military is already looking at trying to develop neural enhancements for soldiers to boost performance and such.\r\n\r\nThere is a definitive downside to all this though; if you're hoping that you can just go \"Oh I'll just try out the mechanical first and then see how 3d printed does in comparison\" that's not going to happen.  A problem that they're finding is that the brain gets severely overly dependent on mechanical replacements.  Essentially when we reach the point of limbs or such being replaced by mechanical ones by healthy individuals they would never be able to go back because the brain gets severely overly dependent.\r\n\r\n\r\nTl:dr; flesh and blood humans may be extinct by 2050 because the human brain gets overly dependent on mechanical replacements meaning that when we have the technology to replace limbs with 3d printed ones even if the neural structure matched up after having mechanical limbs you would never be able to walk again because your brain would be overly dependent on the mechanical prosthetics instead meaning you can bump up your percentage of you that is mechanical but you can't decrease it cause your brain forgets how to use organic limbs entirely.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"552b446d636872754d392100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/552b43d76368725d213f0000#post_552b43d76368725d213f0000\r\nPiccolo has a clothes beam that he uses on Gohan in the Saiyan saga\r\n\r\nIs anything really that far-fetched now?","author":"9ba2e84e636164642cc03200"},{"id":"552b44df636872754d032200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/552b43d76368725d213f0000#post_552b43d76368725d213f0000\r\n\r\nPiccolo's most metro move\r\n\r\n\r\n\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/552b43fd6368727edcdb1200#post_552b43fd6368727edcdb1200\r\n\r\nDeus Ex?
