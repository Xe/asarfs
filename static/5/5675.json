To use a analogy it's like the word \"nigger\"; that word has almost been completely destigmatized and in a decade or two I wouldn't be surprised if it becomes just another english word.\r\n\r\nBasically what I mean by this is that I wouldn't be surprised if say in 2 decades \"nigger\" becomes just a synonym for \"buddy\"; like instead of saying \"what's up\" people use it as a greeting instead to symbolize someone is a friend.  I wouldn't be surprised if \"slut\" just replaces the word \"sexy\".  The problem with the word \"cunt\" is that it doesn't have a destigmatized meaning yet.\r\n\r\nThe best way to get rid of swear words is to redefine them and destigmatize them.  So long as people think of a word as bad it increases the stigmatization of being called it.  The last thing that people who legitimately use the words as insults want is for the stigmatization to be destroyed.  So long as people are afraid of being called those words the people who use them as insults have power.  If the words are no longer feared they no longer have any power.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"553d623463687253789a0d00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Yo man, Broly's nuts","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"553d62786368726aaddc0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/553d623463687253789a0d00#post_553d623463687253789a0d00\r\nSuper Buu eats Broly.\r\nWhat happens?","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"553d62d163687229a9e80000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@toxicrystal\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/553d5edb6368724951531300#post_553d5edb6368724951531300\r\n[bq=\"toxicrystal\"]\"@SeraphimDawn\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/553d5df763687222cfef0300#post_553d5df763687222cfef0300\r\nDUDE YOU ARE BEING FACEBOOK RIGHT NOW WHAT WHY.[/bq]\r\n!http://www.rebellesociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Facebook-Youre-Doing-It-Wrong-550x448.jpg!","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"553d633e6368726aadff0300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/553d62786368726aaddc0200#post_553d62786368726aaddc0200\r\nGenocide of _everything._","author":"515ddf93a4c72d8a1f000d57"},{"id":"553d635e6368722999b50100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/553d62786368726aaddc0200#post_553d62786368726aaddc0200\r\nHard to say\r\nAccording to the Kai's Buu un-absorbing everyone made him stronger\r\n\r\nAlso holy crap they tried to murder a baby\r\nThey fucking stabbed babby Broly","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"553d63a763687229a9e20100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/553d62786368726aaddc0200#post_553d62786368726aaddc0200\r\nSuper Buu absorbs Cell, who absorbs Broly.","author":"500757fd7f123b75a90003b1"},{"id":"553d63d863687269f15e0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Me this morning\r\n!http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/891/976/611.jpg!\r\n\r\nMe this afternoon.\r\n!http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/939/956/9fd.png!\r\n","author":"50c204917f123b31440000a5"},{"id":"553d63f563687269f17c0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SeraphimDawn\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/553d62d163687229a9e80000#post_553d62d163687229a9e80000\r\n@ULTRON LIKE THIS@","author":"31bee2686368722a0df23600"}]}
