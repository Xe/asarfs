What's even funnier is when they forget to code in the enemy AI to react to getting hit by a pistol from that range so you're hitting them from across the map with a pistol and they're completely not reacting to it.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"55355913636872688cc90300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Miyo\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/553558ee63687243a8190b00#post_553558ee63687243a8190b00\r\n\r\nU THENK U HAF TH3 @udacity u SCOPER ","author":"511c09ec7f123b35980001eb"},{"id":"5535599c6368726742ef0900","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/553558f8636872688c9a0300#post_553558f8636872688c9a0300\r\nI kinda noticed that too..
