At those times, it's (usually) not so bad.  They're not trying to sleep with you or anything, they're just dressing up as a character that they like that just so happens to be a different gender from their own.\r\nIt's when they _are_ trying to get in bed with you that it becomes scary.  Thankfully I have never experienced that first-hand, but two of my sisters have had to face that utter creepiness before.\r\n\r\nThough as far as art is concerned, there is something that doesn't sit right in my eyes when I see images on here of crossdressing males.  It might just be that particular artist's style and rendition of it, or it might just be the obviously male proportions not functioning with generally female associations in my brain.\r\nEither way, it can be fine or it can be downright nightmare creepy in my book.  Not much in the way of examples for in between those two ends of the spectrum.","author":"4fde0c7e945b706cc30003eb"},{"id":"539d3ff263687230b6fa0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@PaskaNaakka\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/539d3f4d63687225614f0300#post_539d3f4d63687225614f0300\r\nalso, question about the Finns.\r\n\r\nIs it true you share ancestry with the Hungarians as the Ugric people?","author":"4fe16df67f123b13e400003f"},{"id":"539d407663687230895e0300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Whatevs\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/539d3ff263687230b6fa0200#post_539d3ff263687230b6fa0200\r\nYes.
