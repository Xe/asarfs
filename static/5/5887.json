I mean his stories have to be taken with a healthy dose of irony and self awareness that what you are enjoying is badwrongfun.\r\n\r\nFor instance, Ennis's run on Punisher MAX is highly enjoyable if you can get in the appropriate fourteen year old boy headspace.\r\n\r\nHowever whenever any of this touches the greater Marvel universe I get annoyed. Just once I'd like to see a comic where he shows up and Peter Parker just fucking wrecks his shit.","author":"4f41ee04945b701c41002af7"},{"id":"554839c7636872151b180300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Daredevil FTW","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"554839d5636872151b2b0300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"Toski's post reminded me of this horrible joke\":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1yJsTFLxtg","author":"9ba2e84e636164642cc03200"},{"id":"55483a09636872151b5f0300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@EHAN\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/554839d5636872151b2b0300#post_554839d5636872151b2b0300\r\nThat was forever ago.","author":"5201b5c0a4c72d0d9b0001e4"},{"id":"55483a27636872151b8c0300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@gasmaskangel\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5548398f6368723091880600#post_5548398f6368723091880600\r\nThey did the opposite where peter lost to the Russian, let that sink in,","author":"509f70a87f123b77eb0004fd"},{"id":"55483a416368722463330300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11114/111140422/3659196-guyveriiimoving.gif!","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"55483a51636872151bc30300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@EHAN\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/554839d5636872151b2b0300#post_554839d5636872151b2b0300\r\n!https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/5f/97/ba/5f97ba21742656aec7a89213b8fd2a23.jpg!","author":"536f7a11636872666e2d0000"},{"id":"55483a766368723091020800","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@gasmaskangel\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5548398f6368723091880600#post_5548398f6368723091880600\r\nOh yeah Spidey would utterly RUIN Punisher.\r\n\r\n\"@Thanotos Omega\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55483a27636872151b8c0300#post_55483a27636872151b8c0300\r\nTO be fair though, The Russian made HULK cry.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"55483a956368726c44a31800","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Thanotos Omega\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55483a27636872151b8c0300#post_55483a27636872151b8c0300\r\nThe Russian was actually kinda scary.\r\nLike, if you were a normal, everyday person (which most of you are), imagine how wrecked your shit would be after he fought you.","author":"5201b5c0a4c72d0d9b0001e4"},{"id":"55483aa86368721ac42e0c00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Episode 58\r\n[spoiler]My god Hiei, MY GOD[/spoiler]","author":"505696b47f123b37e800effa"},{"id":"55483b136368721ac4fb0c00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55483a766368723091020800#post_55483a766368723091020800\r\nIt doesn't fucking matter! he's a pice of shit villain from a piece of shit series who Spider man could kill with a slap,","author":"509f70a87f123b77eb0004fd"},{"id":"55483b566368722463770400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@toxicrystal\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55483a956368726c44a31800#post_55483a956368726c44a31800\r\nSpider man can lift a truck and treade punch for punch with the rhino, the russian has no chance in hell,","author":"509f70a87f123b77eb0004fd"},{"id":"55483b5f6368726c44df1900","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Thanotos Omega\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55483a27636872151b8c0300#post_55483a27636872151b8c0300\r\nI know, and it is super fucking obnoxious.
