Well it started talking about vaccines and pig heart transplants and went into how society is rejecting life saving technology.  If I'm not mistaken the total figure of deaths due to people rejecting medical treatment or forcing others to not have medical treatment due to the idea that it \"violated\" their morals came out to be somewhere around a estimated 12 million deaths either through stopping people from being able to receive medical treatments or such.\r\n\r\nThe most shocking example of this is that a couple decades back a country in africa rejected the polio vaccine after a push by the anti-vaccine movement and as a result there was a massive outbreak that killed a lot of people.\r\n\r\nAnother example of this is that we currently have medication to stop the spread of HIV from one person to another and people are outright refusing to take it even if their spouse is known to have HIV.\r\n\r\nSaying that people reject pig heart transplants due to ideology isn't that much a stretch considering that pig hearts and grown organs are receiving all kinds of backlash from individuals that believe the technologies are against their beliefs.\r\n\r\nAnother example of this was that there was a case a couple months ago that was all over the news where two parents rejected cancer therapy for their child calling it a obstruction of their religious beliefs, but the judge ruled that religious freedom doesn't extend to preventing your children from receiving life saving treatment.  Now the kid is okay and the cancer is in remission.\r\n\r\n\r\nTl:dr; the neo-luddite movement is gaining a lot of ground and as a result a lot of people are dying due to rejecting medical treatment or preventing others from receiving medical treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso last time I talked about 3d printed organs on here there was a massive fight with someone saying that 3d printed organs should be banned.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5527097763687263115f1000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/552708246368721e516b0700#post_552708246368721e516b0700\r\nYou know a lot about pulled pork.\r\n\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/552707ab6368720b7a921200#post_552707ab6368720b7a921200\r\nHey, Pierogis are great foods, I'm not complaining.","author":"513e68eda4c72d4e3b000164"},{"id":"552709936368726b318e2000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/552707ab6368720b7a921200#post_552707ab6368720b7a921200\r\nFun little vignette.
