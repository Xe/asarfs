He first puts the carrot in and it comes out soggy. He later puts the egg in and it becomes hard-boiled. Finally, he puts the coffee beans and it becomes, well, coffee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe carrot was a strong figure, both inside and out. He was brave and skilled and pretty much just great. But when faced with the hardships of life, he became weak and soggy and just tired. He was no longer strong and it was a bit humiliating to see him like that.\r\n\r\nThe egg had a hard shell, but was fragile. The inside was soft and loving, that's one of its traits. But when faced with the hardships of life, he became hard and just a plain old jerk. His inside was rock solid and no longer soft. He hated a lot of things and was arrogant and ignorant. He probably even hated his old self. Maybe even his current self.\r\n\r\nThe coffee beans were different than the two. Before facing all that hardships, he was just average. There was nothing special about him that's worth mentioning. But then, the coffee beans disappeared and in its place was a beautiful aroma and surprisingly nice colour. Instead of life changing him, he changed life itself. He faced a lot of hardships and ultimately disappeared. But he left a mark in the world and that mark was something beautiful. Life became beautiful, even though he wasn't there to see it.\r\n\r\nSo, the speech giver asked us which one of these is us. It's obvious what we would answer.","author":"4fe1b9f47f123b13df002976"},{"id":"554860ad63687212b22f1d00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55486043636872684ca42600#post_55486043636872684ca42600\r\nIt's the best, jankiesT game ever","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"554860d16368722fac912b00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/554860556368722f48f70b00#post_554860556368722f48f70b00\r\n...I never told you to read more OPM dude.\r\n\r\nI was trying to counter you by providing examples of why I love OPM.","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"554860e16368722facaf2b00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/554860ad63687212b22f1d00#post_554860ad63687212b22f1d00\r\nSoooooo jaaaaaaank!","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"554860f1636872684ca22700","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I'm logging off and going to sleep.\r\n\"Night guys\":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q_XuWF4r9w","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"554861136368722f48740c00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/554860556368722f48f70b00#post_554860556368722f48f70b00\r\nI guess most of these arguments ends in: *Everyone have different likes and dislikes*.","author":"5239db6da4c72d22d9000358"},{"id":"5548614363687212b29b1d00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/554860d16368722fac912b00#post_554860d16368722fac912b00\r\nSquiggy did.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5548614463687201ea722200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Watching vinny play the totally spies game\r\nLiterally the first thing you see is the girls strutting down a catwalk\r\n\r\nI don't remember this in the show whatsoever ","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"55486165636872684c452800","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Turning in\r\n\r\nNight guys","author":"9ba2e84e636164642cc03200"},{"id":"554861ea63687212b2621e00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5548614463687201ea722200#post_5548614463687201ea722200\r\n[bq=\"Too_Offensive\"]Watching vinny play the *totally spies game*\r\nLiterally the first thing you see is the girls strutting down a catwalk\r\n[/bq]\r\nWut?","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"5548620d6368722656094700","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Shadow the Hedgehog\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/554861136368722f48740c00#post_554861136368722f48740c00\r\n[bq=\"Shadow the Hedgehog\"]\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/554860556368722f48f70b00#post_554860556368722f48f70b00\r\nI guess most of these arguments ends in: *Everyone have different likes and dislikes*.[/bq]\r\nTrash and Squiggy like action; I like romance.
