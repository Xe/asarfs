A brazilian woman of bronze skin with an admirable body toned by years of the hardening labor of dance with long, flawless black hair crowning a face without a single trace of having more than 40 years, all this even after  enduring three pregnancies and the hardships of what we can see is an extremely loving motherhood, add to that the fact that she spends all day occupied by the chores of the house and her own work (which surey makes her quite sweaty) in a leotard and leg warmers and bang. She clearly is the queen of milfs, a \"tremendísima mulata\" if I might add.
