You just seem to go from 0 to supersayain 2 whenever sexuality is involved.  It'd be like watching someone that gets furious whenever people kiss on tv or such go \"I like romance movies\"; of course it would turn a few heads.  I mean you've yelled at a couple users before for talking about gay stuff so it's just kind of weird you know.  It's kind of a asinine thing, but I just kind of assumed you hated stuff like sakura trick.  Basically: you've gotten furious with people for gay stuff -> would not have expected you to enjoy a anime about gay stuff.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5522cb45636872273cd40c00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5522ca6f636872289b740700#post_5522ca6f636872289b740700\r\nAh, style emulation.

His artwork is good, in that his character designs are fucking amazing. But where he suffers is backgrounds and panel layout. Trying reading a recent chapter of Bleach. The panels are often huge and most of the time their virtually blank.
