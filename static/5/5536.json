Let's say a person is super smart for their age and finishes grade 1 in 2 months, they can have if their parents want a month off for vacation and start grade two 3 months into the school year, then if they finish grade 2 in 2 months they can have another vacation, then they have the entire summer off.  If a person is struggling hard then by the time summer starts the only people left in class are people who struggle and thus the teacher has more time to spend on them.  So like at the start of the school year you would have everyone your own age, halfway through half of the class would have gone to a higher grade and by the time summer starts there's only 2 or 3 people left in the class so the teacher can focus solely on you to make sure that you understand it instead of having to focus on 20 people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA even better form of education vs costs personally would be for at the start of the semester everyone start in lectures with everything presented in the lectures with books and such then a competency test with anyone that passes graduating then and those that don't then go into regular classes.  So like half of the class passes in the first half and then those that don't are sorted into small class rooms so that instead of 20 students in the second half you would only have 10 to a class, by the time summer starts less than 5.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5536b01263687256cc810000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5536acb96368726c16b70400#post_5536acb96368726c16b70400\r\nyes\r\n\r\nsupport","author":"9ba2e84e636164642cc03200"},{"id":"5536b0a9636872744e7c0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@EHAN\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5536992a6368727f8a8f3000#post_5536992a6368727f8a8f3000\r\n[spoiler]!http://www.exterminatusnow.co.uk/bonus/wallpaper/nobody_wide.jpg![/spoiler] ","author":"509f70a87f123b77eb0004fd"},{"id":"5536b16a6368726b8c930600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Thanotos Omega\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5536b0a9636872744e7c0000#post_5536b0a9636872744e7c0000\r\nLame.","author":"505696b47f123b37e800effa"},{"id":"5536b18c63687256cc710200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!!http://40.media.tumblr.com/e036a7b13102a3448bd1bacdaa78d4c7/tumblr_n83nmfl9jg1rhavdko1_500.png!\r\n\r\n\r\n\"@Thanotos Omega\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5536b0a9636872744e7c0000#post_5536b0a9636872744e7c0000\r\n@I MUST KEEP WITH EXTERMINATUS NOW@\r\n@THAT SHIT IS AWESOME@","author":"31bee2686368722a0df23600"},{"id":"5536b1df6368726b8c260700","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Matt confirmed for breakfast fascist\r\nA breakfascist","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"5536b1f76368726b8c560700","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@igotnopicks\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5536b16a6368726b8c930600#post_5536b16a6368726b8c930600\r\nBitch Exterminatus Now is fucking awesome,","author":"509f70a87f123b77eb0004fd"},{"id":"5536b23d6368726cc49e0700","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Gizoid101\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5536b18c63687256cc710200#post_5536b18c63687256cc710200\r\nSquiggy confirmed for banned in Australia ","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"5536b2696368724f1c800f00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Gizoid101\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5536b18c63687256cc710200#post_5536b18c63687256cc710200\r\nI know right?
