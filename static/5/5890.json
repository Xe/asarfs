Other superheroes grow by learning their mistakes and such, getting stronger, standing up again yadda yadda but Saitama doesn't have to do that. He's already strong, he beats opponents in one hit which makes nearly zero mistakes and he doesn't even need to stand up. He hates it though by the way.\r\n\r\nIt's good to see something different.","author":"4fe1b9f47f123b13df002976"},{"id":"554850576368722fac241200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view3/1414306/shining-gundam-o.gif!\r\n\r\n*I AM AWAKE*","author":"50c204917f123b31440000a5"},{"id":"554850786368720749010800","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"GOD DAMMIT\r\n\r\nSONIC ADVENTURE IS SO FUCKING COOL\r\n\r\nI NEED TO REINSTALL MY STEAM VERSION\r\n\r\nFUCK","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"5548508463687216f0ac0300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@HJSDGCE\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55484de26368725d6a9c2000#post_55484de26368725d6a9c2000\r\nI'm going on a limb here in saying that Bruce,Dick,or Tom would find a weakness.
