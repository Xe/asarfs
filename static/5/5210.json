It is heavily depressing, but extremely eye opening to a lot of things.  Also it's a banned book so of course you know it's good.\r\n\r\nStory in a nutshell:\r\n[spoiler]Charlie is a mentally impaired person working as a janitor when he undergoes a experimental treatment to increase his intelligence.  As his intelligence increases he realizes that his \"friends\" were only his friends because they felt happy picking on him and felt superior to him and that because his intelligence grows they start to hate him and become jealous.  The treatment starts to reverse and is only temporary and after his intelligence fads he is no longer happy realizing that all his friends are only his friends because they want someone to feel superior to.[/spoiler]\r\n\r\nIt's a really eye opening book because there are insane amounts of people like that in the world and people like Charlie's friends are extremely common.\r\n\r\nI've seen how bad people like Charlie get treated and how much people that are \"nice\" just want to feel better about themselves; hypothetically if we ever do develop say intelligence enhancements for mentally disabled people I would not be surprised if we saw crowds of people trying to rip the enhancement out of the patients' skulls by people that were previously their \"friends\".\r\n\r\nIf you ever want to know how bad our mental care is legitimately hang out with people that are mentally disabled one day; not take care of them or such, but play say tag football or something with them to understand the difference between how they're treated and how other people are treated; it's just beyond utterly fucking soul crushing how much they just outright don't get treated like humans.  I talked about it in the unpopular opinion thread, but I was buds with a guy that struggled in class and kept trying and trying and trying and spending all his time trying to prove that he could pass normal classes and the teacher kept preventing him from going to normal classes and get at least a C- or something.  Why?  Cause if he left she would no longer feel mentally superior to him and she would constantly do everything in her power to prevent any of the handicap kids from going to normal classes and spout off about how she was such a \"good\" person for preventing students from taking normal classes.\r\n\r\n\r\nI really suggest reading flowers for algernon; yes it's a really fucking depressing book but it's a really good book that opens your eyes to how poorly people get treated by \"friends\" \"helping\" them.\r\n\r\nTl:dr; go read flowers for algernon right this instant!  It's depressing as fuck, but it's really eye opening and life changing.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"55237ea66368721974070500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"So as I've mentioned a few times, I've been playing Xenoblade on an emulator as I wait for the official release on the 3DS. And, in a moment of boredom, I got to wondering, how tall are the Bionis and Mechonis? So I ran an experiment in-game to find out- I won't bore you with all the details, but based on my (probably inaccurate) calculations, I estimated the two to be about 10,773 meters tall.
