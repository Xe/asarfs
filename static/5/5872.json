He only weights like 80 pounds now (he's like 6' 5\"), *BUT* he is in perfect health.  He medically has a good forty years left in him.  If you're that fucked up physically to the point that you literally look like a skeleton with skin on you, can barely function but you have forty years left in your life that's a hell of a punishment.  The guy is either going to live out the rest of his life barely functional or he's going to wind up killing himself cause he can't take it, but chances are he's not going to kill himself for a while cause if he dies his mom loses her income (my ex-step dad was military and received retirement or whatever it's called) and his mom has a good 20 years left.  So conservatively speaking he has to live another 20 years as a borderline cripple and can't kill himself cause if he does kill himself before his mom dies then she loses her source of food.\r\n\r\nIf god does exist he brought the pain hammer down hard.\r\n\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5547ded963687253e1330300#post_5547ded963687253e1330300\r\nOkay; let's talk about something else then.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5547dff6636872368db90100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5547df446368726b82d80700#post_5547df446368726b82d80700\r\nThat's...a fate worse than death.","author":"515ddf93a4c72d8a1f000d57"},{"id":"5547e00c636872788cfa2200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5547dc8563687214984c0c00#post_5547dc8563687214984c0c00\r\nSorry about that shit man\r\n\r\n\r\nBut Oct 4th, I'm getting you something","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"}]}
