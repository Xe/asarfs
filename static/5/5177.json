Also a relationship aspect to them and every enemy is recruitable.  Obviously you couldn't have a random character have a relationship with main characters due to having all that dialogue for every random character is impossible but you still be able to hook up your minions together.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"552197406368724b189c0b00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@ArcticEight\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/552196fc6368724b641c0a00#post_552196fc6368724b641c0a00\r\nDid you not see me and umm that three random characters guy? we weren't being hyper civil either,","author":"509f70a87f123b77eb0004fd"},{"id":"5521977a6368724b86e60900","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@ArcticEight\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/552196fc6368724b641c0a00#post_552196fc6368724b641c0a00\r\nNo no no, Its ok my friend.\r\n\r\nBesides, We all act like douches at times.
