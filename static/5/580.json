Or at least the Kowloon Walled City. Sort of like \"Condemned: Criminal Origins\":https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrekaHLD2rhZRkubQNmmw1ndoZt-sNapr, but with more Chinese cops, British-owned Hong Kong, and justified, creepy interiors.[/bq]\r\nWell there is a GTA style crime/police game called Sleeping Dogs/Undercover in Hong Kong. But just thinking about a _Condemned_ style horror game that takes place in Hong Kong Kowloon Walled City, like what you said, gives me the creeps. Chinese themes are way to under used in medias such as video games.","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"53a4ad0f6368720678350000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"The number of cases so far is only about 300, but outbreak numbers wise that's the point at which things start to hit the fan.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53a4ad6363687203aa300000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I don't think Ebola will cross the Sahara.","author":"50b70eeb7f123b1a02000097"},{"id":"53a4ad746368720588380000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Background Pony #C086\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53a4ac9b63687204400f0000#post_53a4ac9b63687204400f0000\r\n\r\n\r\nearl sweatshirts father, one of the most influential poets, came from africa.","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"53a4add26368720492660000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Randomosaur\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53a4ad6363687203aa300000#post_53a4ad6363687203aa300000\r\n[bq=\"Randomosaur\"]I don't think Ebola will cross the Sahara.[/bq]\r\nObviously, but that's still going to wind up being a lot of people dead.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53a4ae07636872035eab0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"In a cynical point of view, less people will probably free up urban space and alleviate squalor in some of the shitty places where there's no money there to even clean it up with.

But presuming Black Death-level economics you could theorize that a drop in land costs brought on by a indiscriminate drop in population may allow for otherwise poorer people to get better land elsewhere.\r\n\r\nBut ultimate the need to improve these areas will demand significant long-term investment, which has too much risk for western economies to go into.
