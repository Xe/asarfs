Lemme see [/bq]\r\n\r\nHere is one of the shadow game bits from the manga\r\n\r\n\r\nGriddle Ice Hockey was an air hockey-like Shadow Game, Dark Yugi played against Goro Inogashira. A giant heated grill and spatulas were used as the field and bats. A test tube of explosive chemicals embedded in a block of ice was used as a puck. Players used their bats to hit the chemicals towards their opponent. If the chemicals touched the hot grille, a player could be injured by the explosion. Goro initially had the upperhand as he dealt powerful blows, but Dark Yugi managed to crack the ice, such that it broke next time Goro hit it, causing the chemicals to explode in front of him.[7]\t\r\n\r\n","author":"37e5b9d66361642500af5e00"},{"id":"55327d61636872508bf00600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Kaz\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55327b0863687250985a0200#post_55327b0863687250985a0200\r\nLooking good!\r\nYou're right though, he does look pretty stiff. You need to figure out away to make your characters loosen up a bit. Like maybe try making a headless character as an exercise. He'd have to move around in wacky ways to express himself. \r\nAnd I notice you try to draw a bit of musculature to the anatomy on your characters. If you have trouble posing them and maintaining those shapes, try drawing their limbs all noodley for the time being.
