FOR THE BOTH OF US!\r\n\r\nAlso Nah I really have been sleeping a lot lately. What happens is like, I go to sleep at a good time like 10:00 and than wake up at 1:00 in the morning.\r\n\r\nAnd after that it gets REALLY hard to get back to bed and I end up staying up the rest of the night. \r\n\r\nAnd than when morning hits I end up getting sleepy and go to sleep and wake up somewhere around 3:00 and than it keeps happening over and over again.\r\n\r\nI've been hit with the broken sleep schedule loop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/553ca93e6368725508790f00#post_553ca93e6368725508790f00\r\nIt is really good!

Also, Pegasus must read the reason of edit first.\r\n\r\n[spoiler]Luffy's usual rubber ability is based on a rubber band. It hurts when you hit someone with it. In G2, Luffy uses his rubber-ness to pump blood faster in his body. G3 is based on a balloon, with its expanding ability while Haki-infused G3 is based on the balloons you use to make balloon animals. G4, by my opinion, is based on a thick-surfaced rubber ball and spring. Spring, like his attacks which are similar to Bellamy's but stronger, while rubber ball as based on his entire body, expanding his muscles instead of his bones.[/spoiler]","author":"4fe1b9f47f123b13df002976"},{"id":"553cb26063687217f7be0c00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@HJSDGCE\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/553cb22e63687212a0261000#post_553cb22e63687212a0261000\r\nThat technically is spoilers.
