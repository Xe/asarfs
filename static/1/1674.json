There's algae biofuel being worked on, solar roadways, fusion energy is actually making massive strides, solar cells are far more efficient now than ten years ago, there's experimental prototype cars that use a small combustion engine to power a generator to power the wheels cause it's far more efficient.  Chances are the cars of the future will rely on algae biofuel to power a small engine to run electric motors in car wheels cause if you put in all the loss of power between the engine and the wheels there's a massive drop in efficiency.\r\n\r\nUpside: algae biofuel/electric hybrid cars potentially would be far more efficient.\r\nDownside: If you want a super powerful truck capable of running your neighbor's car over and turning it into paste you're out of luck buddy cause that shit's going to be way out of your league financially.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5421de2f6368721dfa210000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5421dcf76368724073620000#post_5421dcf76368724073620000\r\n\r\n\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5421dc3c6368723871450000#post_5421dc3c6368723871450000\r\n\r\n\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5421dd3c6368727e422c0000#post_5421dd3c6368727e422c0000\r\n\r\nSounds like we got a lot to do, guys! *DERPIBOORU CLUB...

Once they figure out how to make algae biofuel less expensive the entire oil industry is going to collapse overnight; at this point it's a question of when is oil going to become obsolete, not \"if\".  My money is on less than 10 years.  In 2009 algae biofuel costed $33/gallon.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5421e1056368722f9dca0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"i hate the so called golden age of hip hop.\r\n\r\ni feel like im the only one that doesnt like 80´s or 90´s music.\r\n\r\nin fact, with the reinassance of hip hop, any other album coming will beat the crap out of whatever people came up with before.\r\n\r\n\r\nalso, do people make the touhou vocals themselves or something?","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"5421e1c36368727d8a350000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@twistedmetalero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5421e1056368722f9dca0100#post_5421e1056368722f9dca0100\r\nYes; they make the vocals themselves.
