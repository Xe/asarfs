It's been nine years too.  I use to play baseball and sports all the time and I still weigh the same as I do now.\r\n\r\nThe longest I ever went without food, other than bread, was two weeks I think and I still weighed the same.  Even scarfing down on a all you can eat buffet doesn't add any extra pounds either.  I could swallow a double chocolate cake; it wouldn't add any pounds to my stomach at all and I'd still be perfectly healthy regardless.\r\n\r\nIt's not just my weight, height or how I look either; my family ages extremely slowly.  My great-grandmother was 90-something, looked like she was sixty, was always outside taking care of her garden and totally self-sufficient.  My grandmother is about seventy and before she destroyed herself abusing drugs she looked about forty and was active.  My mom is 55, looks thirty and is still physically fit enough to do more physical activity than someone half her age.\r\n\r\nI didn't just win the genetic lottery; I won the genetic multimillion lottery.  That means I'm going to be one of those people that pushes well past a hundred, still looks young, just with gray hair(no baldness isn't in my family either) and still fit enough to take care of myself.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"533c67cb6368725028070200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/533c5ce96368725c88100200#post_533c5ce96368725c88100200\r\nCan i use your superior genetic material to engineer a race of extremely xenophobic, immobile squid-brain creatures that feel nothing but hate?","author":"5007bbdf7f123b112f00023a"},{"id":"533c69b16368721180860100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@PaskaNaakka\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/533c67cb6368725028070200#post_533c67cb6368725028070200\r\n\r\nOnly if they come with extermination rays.
