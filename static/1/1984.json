Ughhhhh. . . christ. . .\r\nIf you all are wondering why Ebola is spreading so much here's something that bluntly illustrates the reason why; someone in new york caught ebola, but two police officers who were on duty disposed of their protective gear into a garbage can.  The two police officers never entered the apartment and it posed no threat, but christ some people are dense.  If you're wondering why Ebola is spreading so far imagine this, now imagine it on a large scale.  The number of times people have broken quarantine procedures is shockingly high.  Shit like this is why aids is all over the place; wear your protection properly and don't dispose of it in public places where other people can potentially come in contact with it.  If you get Ebola for the love of whatever god you believe in/don't believe in/flying spaghetti monster or whatever don't touch other people, don't have them over tackle football, don't have intercourse with them, don't touch no one, don't kiss no one, get your ass into the hospital asap cause the sooner you get to the hospital the more likely you are to survive; wait too long and you're dead.\r\n\r\nAlthough the probability of anyone outside of the infected countries is incredibly small, but still some people are fucking dense.  Christ, I think people would understand the virus better if they used a analogy equating it to cooties, but instead if you touch the person you fucking die.  I'm feeling like people need a fucking crayola chart drawn out for them with pictures and such for some people to understand this cause some people are dumb, some people are really dumb, but then again with how dumb people are acting it would have to be drawings without any words and telling the people about Ebola through puppets and song to get through to these people.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"544a37dd6368722120670000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Yay, it's over!
