There's plenty of conflicts, but I don't think you would call fifty deaths a fullblown war.  Contrary to popular belief there's only 10 wars right now and five of which are cooling down and will be classified as conflicts soon.  There's less and less total number of wars in the world and as time goes on this trend will continue until \"world peace\" is achieved in that with the exception of the middle east war will become a very rare occurrence.  There will always be war in the world, but with the exception of the middle east wars will only happen once every couple decades or so.\r\n\r\nTl:dr; everywhere else in the world there will probably be zero wars in the world or they will only happen every couple decades but the middle east will always be a hotbed for wars.\r\n\r\nTl:dr; 2040: almost all wars will be solely in the middle east.\r\n\r\n*edit damn it; can't play league yet cause I have to wait for something.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"540554f06368727d02480100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5405508863687201db6e0000#post_5405508863687201db6e0000\r\nI gotcha","author":"4fe16df67f123b13e400003f"},{"id":"540556fe6368720594c30100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":">Put spoons on eyes\r\n\r\n>Pretend to be Ultraman","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"540557636368721d417a0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/540556fe6368720594c30100#post_540556fe6368720594c30100\r\n\r\nnerd\r\n[spoiler]>puts hand on dick\r\n>pretends it squiggy's[/spoiler]","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"540557d86368722f204e0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/540557636368721d417a0000#post_540557636368721d417a0000\r\nOoohhhh naughty boy~","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"540557f06368726051240000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/540557636368721d417a0000#post_540557636368721d417a0000\r\n\r\nSit on it till it's numb (the hand)","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"5405583e6368723052420100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@QuasarNova\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/540557f06368726051240000#post_540557f06368726051240000\r\ni've tried in the past\r\nit doesn't seem to work","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"54055ad0636872361d1a0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"i'm gonna go to bed soon\r\nlove you guys\r\n*hugs to everyone*\r\n\r\ni LOVE you squiggy\r\n*kisses*","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"54055b08636872730abf0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54055ad0636872361d1a0100#post_54055ad0636872361d1a0100\r\nGood night My love.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54055e346368726405490000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54055b08636872730abf0000#post_54055b08636872730abf0000\r\n:) (hearing these words makes me really happy)\r\n\r\nactually going to bed now\r\nnight all","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"5405615c63687221fb6e0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Gotta Snooze Fast.\r\nG'night people.","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"540563b9636872165b000000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"FINALLY, FINALLY.\r\n\r\nAFTER YEAR I FIND THAT SONG THAT I HEARD IN THE RADIO SO FUCKING MUCH","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"540563db6368723912730000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@twistedmetalero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/540563b9636872165b000000#post_540563b9636872165b000000\r\nWhat was it?","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"540564b263687238e4af0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/540563db6368723912730000#post_540563db6368723912730000\r\n\r\n!http://ts1.mm.bing.net/th?id=HN.608045572702341676&pid=15.1&P=0!\r\n\r\nby outkast nonetheless\r\n\r\n\"My baby don't mess around\r\nBecause she loves me so\r\nAnd this I know for sho\"\r\n","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"540579e2636872135a080100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Holy shit.
