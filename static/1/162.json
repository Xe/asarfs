They're seriously a great, caring person, and you have no doubt in your mind about that. But then, all of a sudden, they tell you some really shitty view for an even shittier reason - like, say, refusing to acknowledge the existence of their child if he/she came out as trans because \"God wouldn't like it\" - what then? You know that they're so much more than that one terrible view, but it's just so bad. Add that to the fact that when you told them it was shitty, they told you to go fuck yourself.\r\n\r\nYeah, this is _totally_ hypothetical.

Don't let one or two different views on things ruin a relationship.

Ray Kurzweil may be a computer genius, but he doesn't know jack shit about biology or neuroscience and he also believes in quack medicine.[/bq]\r\nI'm going to have to disagree with you here on the premise of the blue brain project is making a lot of major strides as of late.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the blue brain project is to map how the human brain works and reverse engineer it.  When you get right down to it the human brain is just another computer, albeit a very complex one.  The problem we as a species seem to have is that we're extremely arrogant about our own abilities.  Even though we have machines that can outperform us in a lot of fields we still believe that we are fundamentally superior to everything in every facet imaginable.\r\n\r\nThe other problem we have is that we're arrogant about our understanding of technological advancement.  Fifty years ago if you told someone that we would have machines that can perform better than humans and that technological advancement would be causing mass unemployment due to people getting replaced in the workforce you probably would have gotten locked up in a insane asylum and people calling you a \"crazy dirty commie\" or something along the lines.\r\n\r\nIn a hundred years we're going to have laptops so powerful that their computational ability is more than the combined computational ability of the entire human race combined.  What I mean by this is say in a hundred years if a single laptop is more powerful than the entire human race's mental capacity don't you think running a simulation of a single human's brain is possible?","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5352cca2636872563fb30100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":">_> Well fuck me sideways.\r\n\r\nTurns out the usa is a oligarchy, not a democracy.
