Touhou was crazy ass large in Japan and now boat marriage: the game is now #1.  I doubt Kantai will ever come to the USA cause the antagonist is the USA in the games, but Touhou is coming to the west.\r\n\r\nFor those of you that just went, \"what the fuck are you talking about?\": Touhou is about to be fucking big in the west cause imagine how popular Pokemon is; that's about as how popular Touhou is in Japan.  Touhou is coming to the west so imagine how popular Pokemon is, now imagine this level of popularity for Touhou in the west.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you're going to \"what the fuck is a Kantai\"?  It's a Japanese freemium browser dating sim where you date humanizations of Japanese WWII warships.  The reason why it'll never come to the west is that the villain in the games is the USA fleet.  It's mainly a dating sim; the reason why it's generating so much money is you have to pay money to marry the ship and people are wanting to marry all their ships.  In other words you're shipping ships while shipping ships to ship ships so you can ship your ships.\r\n\r\n[/Japan otaku culture]","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53e024466368725a9a1e0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53e023e263687201b0070100#post_53e023e263687201b0070100\r\nI thought Kantai was a card game....","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"53e02463636872716a920000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53e023e263687201b0070100#post_53e023e263687201b0070100\r\n[bq=\"uc9\"]It’s a Japanese freemium browser dating sim *where you date humanizations of Japanese WWII warships*[/bq]\r\n\r\nI've reached that point where nothing surprises me anymore.\r\nOr at least, I thought I did.\r\nWhat the _FUCK?_","author":"515ddf93a4c72d8a1f000d57"},{"id":"53e024896368723489610100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!https://31.media.tumblr.com/990c7fdee9e8f2b187ec2a3a381a31e8/tumblr_n8wyzl9Qct1r61a7no1_500.gif!\r\n!https://38.media.tumblr.com/e10fe07ed60e39508d5e9b49272bcad6/tumblr_n8wyzl9Qct1r61a7no2_500.gif!\r\n!https://33.media.tumblr.com/d14a75f4e21d500d27936b3d9c980001/tumblr_n8wyzl9Qct1r61a7no3_r1_500.gif!\r\nDamn.","author":"50c204917f123b31440000a5"},{"id":"53e024d4636872716aba0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53e024466368725a9a1e0000#post_53e024466368725a9a1e0000\r\nIt's a browser dating sim that the is pretty much a card game battle.\r\n\r\nIt's not that good to be honest; sure the dating sim part I like, but the actual gameplay is pretty meh.
