To use a analogy it'd be like if someone in 1500 spent a hundred billion dollars in today's money for a car.  Sure you could get it done if you spent enough money to get enough people to develop it but it would be a experimental prototype and the only one and it would cost a hundred billion dollars to make.  You could theoretically make someone a full cyborg but it'd be really fucking expensive and you'd only be able to make the one.\r\n\r\nThe people that go, \"well if I don't have it now it'll never happen\" don't understand that in order to run a business financially successfully you need to generate a profit and dropping a hundred billion left and right just cause you feel like it is a quick ass way to go bankrupt.\r\n\r\nAsking people to wait a decade for something in the experimental prototype phase to come out isn't that much to ask.\r\n\r\n\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53f15f056368725f1a1e0100#post_53f15f056368725f1a1e0100\r\nBrain-machine interfaces that can be hooked up to your nervous system; it's being worked on right now, but it's the single greatest barrier to cyborgs; once we have that we're golden.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53f160a963687232e4020000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53f15f056368725f1a1e0100#post_53f15f056368725f1a1e0100\r\nI would like to see a Virtual reality type thing that can be applied directly to your mind or something.
