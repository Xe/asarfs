Specially considering the mental history of some of the astronauts that end up coming back.\r\n\r\nAnd for that matter, should the NASA need to focus more on that aspect before sending them? How much more would that mean in terms of their budget if they supposedly don't get enough for it?","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"53fea9156368723c76a90000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I want to see more Trap art now.

They know what they're doing.  The reason why the ISS is to carry out science experiments that are not possible under normal conditions and the robot is a test in of itself.  Just cause we're not on the moon doesn't mean science isn't being done.\r\n\r\nAlso keep in mind that NASA needs a fuck ton of more money as it is.  They need at least 1% of the annual budget to function and are massively underfunded.  NASA is our first and last line of defense against meteors and shit.  The 1914 tunguska meteor landed in a remote part of Russia and broke windows all the way in Finland; if something like that landed today in say New York it would wipe out tens of millions of people.  NASA needs far more money than they are currently getting to track potential impacts and come up with a plan of attack cause contrary to movies using a nuke would create a shotgun effect that would make a impact a hundred times worst.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53feaa7b63687222ba540100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@PaskaNaakka\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53fea9586368723f3c840000#post_53fea9586368723f3c840000\r\n\r\nDon't forget this one:\r\n\r\n!http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20121001044858/glee/images/a/a7/Mine.gif!","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"53feab276368726a43d00000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Let me explain to you why chica is #1 waifu\r\n\r\n1.
