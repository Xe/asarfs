I really hope that RWBY becomes more popular cause maybe then the dumbfucks that go, \"thems webuus likes thims anumatuns su I culd du itt too; who neuds reseach?\" will get it through their thick fucking skulls to do research into their consumer base.\r\n\r\nThat's why I find the western anime before avatar and rwby so annoying was that those before it did zero research at all into their consumer base and thought that the sole singular reason why people like anime is the art style.  The very first rule of making a product is understanding your consumer base and it's so annoying how often people don't realize this or ignore it entirely.  Avatar and rwby are the first two western anime to have actually done any level of research into what consumers like and that's why they're successful.\r\n\r\nTl:dr; if you have a product that your consumer doesn't want then you're going to have a bad time.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"542b0dd063687201bcd30100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@And Brother I Hurt People\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/542b0d736368727e9ba60100#post_542b0d736368727e9ba60100\r\n\r\nThey eat other insects (scorpions and like their namesakes).

No one wears any armor specifically made for bites and everyone uses guns to shoot zombies when the number one rule of zombie apocalypses is loud noises = attracting the horde.\r\n\r\nProbably the reason why so few people in zombie apocalypse movies survive is you shoot your gun then every fucking zombie in the next half mile knows food is near.\r\n\r\nI would straight up have no problem surviving a zombie apocalypse because the most important things on how to survive are 1)get a good knife 2)get armor to protects against bites and such that is cushioned so you can move around with little noise 3)mask your scent(like cover yourself in mud and such) 4)keep provisions in hard to find stashes instead of a singular location with what is in them being diverse so if someone steals one stash you're not up shit creek 5)keep yourself light and make it bluntly aware to people you have nothing on you 6)set up barb wire and shit at choke points to prevent hordes from being able to form cause the more points where zombies can move about freely the more likely they are to be able to clump together.\r\n\r\nThe best way to deal with zombie hordes isn't to just lay a bunch of traps at a singular safe house; rather it's to prevent zombies from clumping together in groups.  The more and more zombies clumping together the more and more they will form hordes; the more and more they're spread out from each other the easier they are to deal with.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"542b2134636872193eb60100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/542b1ffd6368722cac490100#post_542b1ffd6368722cac490100\r\nMy zombie apocalypse plan: Join the horde.","author":"5007bbdf7f123b112f00023a"},{"id":"542b243c6368725497f40000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@PaskaNaakka\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/542b2134636872193eb60100#post_542b2134636872193eb60100\r\nMy zombie apocalypse plan: Reenact Thriller down the streets ","author":"50c204917f123b31440000a5"},{"id":"542b2497636872091b410100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"So you're obsessed with Zombies now uc9?","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"}]}
