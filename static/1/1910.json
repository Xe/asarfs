Like personally I think there are god/s, but not in the way we think they are nor do they serve a purpose we think they do.  To use a analogy I think they're more along the lines of \"one above all\" from Marvel; not really a \"god\" or there to play baby sitter or to create life or anything traditionally associated with god/s so much as there to make sure no one tries to destroy the universes and make sure no one destroys all of reality.  They'll never step in to stop you from doing something, but the second you try to destroy all the universes you're fucked.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"543eecac63687264580c0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Princess♠Molestia\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/543eec476368721a4bfe0000#post_543eec476368721a4bfe0000\r\n\r\nYou're already trained.\r\n\r\n","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"543eecc363687232353a0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Princess♠Molestia\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/543eec476368721a4bfe0000#post_543eec476368721a4bfe0000\r\nYES YES FEAR THE TATLE TAIL SUCH AS I!\r\n\r\n\r\n\"@Princess♠Molestia\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/543eec476368721a4bfe0000#post_543eec476368721a4bfe0000\r\nOh shit some ones pokemons about to get REKT!\r\n\r\n[spoiler]I bet this is just full of amazing[/spoiler] ","author":"50c204917f123b31440000a5"},{"id":"543eed5563687243a94c0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Number1pegasus\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/543eecc363687232353a0100#post_543eecc363687232353a0100\r\nIt's weeeeeeird.\r\n\r\nhttp://v2012.mangapark.com/manga/hokuto-no-ken-pocket-monsters-pok%25c3%25a9mon-tougijou-doujinshi","author":"500757fd7f123b75a90003b1"},{"id":"543eed866368725053580200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/543eec7a63687239637e0100#post_543eec7a63687239637e0100\r\n\r\nThat comes more into the \"What they do\" rather than the \"What they are\" territory.\r\n\r\nIt's like when you get a job, you have your desk, and the job that comes with it.\r\n\r\nThen you get a prrrrrrrrrrrromotion and you're moved into another area, where you deal with other stuff, sometimes more important, and so forth.\r\n\r\nA God is a creator first and foremost, but after creating that life, they move into another cycle or leave another God to micro manage the rest.","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"543eedde63687231a3d80100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Princess♠Molestia\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/543eed5563687243a94c0200#post_543eed5563687243a94c0200\r\n_*OH MY GOD JESSIE!*_\r\n\r\n!http://a.mpcdn.net/manga/p/18054/424709/3.jpg!\r\n*OH MY GOD*\r\n\r\n","author":"50c204917f123b31440000a5"}]}
