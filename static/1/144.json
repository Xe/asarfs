When you get a slap in the face like that it can make you a bit paranoid about future ones, hence people's reaction to her high heels.\r\n\r\nPersonally I think they look kinda silly and that maybe it was a bad idea to have her wearing them given the bad taste Other M left in everyone's mouth. I get that they're supposed to be rocket shoes or whatever, but surely there is a less retarded looking design they could have used.","author":"4f41ee04945b701c41002af7"},{"id":"53501e3e63687269a9e60000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@HeroInferno\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/535019b46368720db3830000#post_535019b46368720db3830000\r\nYeah, but the co-producer on the team that makes metroid said he wanted to work on new franchises and such instead of things like metroid.  It's the same reason why starfox is six feet under as well; they do *NOT* want to work on a new game.  It's not that they don't have the ability to make a new game, rather they have no intention of doing so.\r\n\r\nSorry starfox fans, but your franchise is officially dead.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5350244d6368722ecf360000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53501e3e63687269a9e60000#post_53501e3e63687269a9e60000\r\nJontron is now rolling in his grave","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"53506d1163687233eb180000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"*OH SHIT!*\r\n\r\nYeah I know I keep talking about ukraine, but that eastern part of ukraine that is currently in the news with illegal militia and wanting to join russia sent out fliers to the people living in there that all jews must register themselves with pro-russian forces or face their citizenship in the city revoked, thrown out and their property seized.\r\n\r\nScumbag pro-russian milita: seizes town under pretense of \"protecting people of russian descent\" then orders jews to register with them.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"535070426368720461220000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53506d1163687233eb180000#post_53506d1163687233eb180000\r\nYeah, that jew register?
