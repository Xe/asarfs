However iron clad the case seems there may be circumstances that later exonerate the accused, exoneration that would do a fat lot of good to the poor sod who had his genitalia unjustly destroyed.\r\n\r\nThis is also why I am morally opposed to the death penalty.\r\n\r\nOnce you crush the genitals of a single innocent person you reveal that your concern is neither justice or care of the victim, but rather is simply vengeance driven blood lust.","author":"4f41ee04945b701c41002af7"},{"id":"540685336368720625eb0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@gasmaskangel\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/540684cd6368727371b30100#post_540684cd6368727371b30100\r\n...\r\nyeah...","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"5406856a63687279fd370200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Why does the printer requiere yellow or cyan to print if it's only in black and white?","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"540685836368725ee71f0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5406834363687279e09e0100#post_5406834363687279e09e0100\r\nIt's the \"Time Wasting Thread\" talk about anything.","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"540685b86368720780d30100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@QuasarNova\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5406856a63687279fd370200#post_5406856a63687279fd370200\r\nProbably because printer cartridges are a scam.

You're using the wrong printer settings in that the generic color settings is cmyk; what you want to use for black and white is black and white.  There's three major printing settings, rgb is crap color and you never use it professionally, cmyk is better, black and white and you use this to save money when printing books and such.  If you use cmyk when printing black and white it'll use all the colors, if you use black and white it'll just use black.\r\nDude's bullshiting you.\r\n<Degree in printing","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5406877563687232614f0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/540686e5636872646c860000#post_540686e5636872646c860000\r\nTHE END IS NIGH!
