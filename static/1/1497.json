IBM is developing computer chips to mimic the human brain for personal computers; the reason why this is cool in that it'll pretty much end computer errors in that you'll have a part of your cpu specifically dedicated to fixing computer errors as well as fixing programming errors.  Nanoparticles are being looked at to eliminate ALL viruses.\r\n\r\nHow lizards regrow limbs has been found out by the Arizona state university; this means in the future humans could regrow limbs cause humans already have the tools to.  Basically the way lizards regrow limbs is that a scab forms, but instead of closing the gap new cartilage forms and a type of stem cells begins dividing and regrowing under the scab.  Humans may very well regrow limbs in the future.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"540e5ec96368725ca49d0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SeraphimDawn\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/540e5c196368727b84dc0000#post_540e5c196368727b84dc0000\r\nBe right back, I need to uuuhhh, replace my brain real quick.

So while it's entirely possible for Miku and such to become real life androids, but there will probably only be one of each of them cause of how fucking expensive we're talking.  When we eventually have the ability to make androids we're easily talking tens of million dollars for each one cause we're talking experimental prototypes.  Experimental prototypes are fucking expensive.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"540e60836368727b84b00100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://38.media.tumblr.com/5912f95a20eac1633126726949503f60/tumblr_n93igutqkK1rhavdko1_500.png!\r\ndo you think all of this research on how humans work will affect us in this aspect\r\ngiving humans access to their deep down super strength","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"540e61b963687206d9470000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Here's some good news: the cease fire in Ukraine is holding.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"540e61ec63687239ef060000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I've been recently missing the old days when it comes to games.\r\n\r\nI miss all these, cool and weird games that I played as a kid.","author":"50c204917f123b31440000a5"},{"id":"540e625b6368724debc40000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SeraphimDawn\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/540e5d2d636872563c870000#post_540e5d2d636872563c870000\r\nDisappeared but yeah I agree that doesn't look like Bomberman at all.
