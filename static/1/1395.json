When you get down to it the villain is the hero of their own story in that the most horrible people in history thought they were the hero.  There's a lot of corrupt people that I wouldn't necessarily call evil, they're just corrupt and then you get the outright bastards who thinking harming others is what is best in the person you're harming best interest.  I know I could use a extreme case, but I'll go for one of the lesser every day cases; the people that disown their gay children and thrown them out into the street/sign them up for -brainwashing- \"curing the gay\" that's evil in that they're deliberately harming people cause they believe directly harming people is the good thing.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5403a43f63687225b9210000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5403a0616368726d54bc0000#post_5403a0616368726d54bc0000\r\n1. Yes to the first, no to the latter\r\n2. Not really\r\n3. Does wanting to live a good life count? Or do you mean a sort of 'look how noble I am\"? Yes to the former, no if the latter.\r\n4. God no. \r\n5. No.\r\n6. No, I can't handle that responsibility\r\n7. No for that reason. Only if they are doing something horribly wrong.\r\n8. No, but... I do think there is a point where there is a greater good that vastly outweighs the cost.\r\n\r\nHere is an example I thought of: let us say the US dissolves and is partitioned according to ideological groups. So Republicans get a slice, democrats get a slice, Libertarians etc. Now many Libertarians would object to have people moved because that is coercion, however not only is it the only way to get their society but others will have no issues with doing so and marginalizing other groups. So in that situation I think they should deal with the movement of people simply to keep up with history in the face of an unavoidable paradigm shift.  \r\n\r\n","author":"4fe16df67f123b13e400003f"},{"id":"5403a4476368726bcbf30100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://wac.450f.edgecastcdn.net/80450F/ultimateclassicrock.com/files/2012/06/Talking-Heads-Gif.gif!","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"5403a4ad63687225b9660000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Zx1prmT0L.jpg!","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"5403a52963687269e2b30100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Whatevs\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5403a43f63687225b9210000#post_5403a43f63687225b9210000\r\nThere's nothing wrong with 1 on some cases in that if say you're trying to prove that the morality of \"don't kill random people\" is morally superior; there's nothing wrong with wanting a good life.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5403a56e6368726b61250200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5403a52963687269e2b30100#post_5403a52963687269e2b30100\r\nfor me I think one should try to prove their ideas to be better as a marketplace of ideas thing.\r\n","author":"4fe16df67f123b13e400003f"},{"id":"5403a5a96368726c91fc0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"whenever I see those \"derpibooru is filled with terrible shitbabbies\" tumblrs that post comments from this site, I never see my name\r\nI don't understand\r\nam I not too offensive enough? \r\ndo I dishonor my name?
