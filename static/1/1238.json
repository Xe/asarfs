The malls suck hard cause they literally only have the bare basics of what you would call a mall so I don't go to them and the movie theater is clear across town and it's just not worth it.  The college I'm at there's fuck all to do; all we really have is a basketball court and a tennis court.  I've already watched all the movies from the library; they don't have any good books cause they're all mainly for school classes.  I can't get tv in my room cause it'd be fucking expensive to get it.  So my only real options of how to spend my free time is play video games/read fanfics or watch porn and I've already beaten almost all of my games(I only have 6 games left that I have yet to beat so I'm going to be completely out of unplayed games by the end of next week as well since I'm going to have a week of literally nothing to do).\r\n\r\nWhile I don't have a lot of free time lately the fact that I don't have anything to do in my free time other than look at the clock waiting for class is annoying.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53f28fe4636872484fba0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53f28f3663687245e27a0100#post_53f28f3663687245e27a0100\r\n[spoiler]Reminding you that Kamen rider exists.[/spoiler]","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"53f290df63687234ce350100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53f28fe4636872484fba0000#post_53f28fe4636872484fba0000\r\nI know.\r\n\r\nI'll probably watch it over my week off.
