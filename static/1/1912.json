Or whoever is responsible for this. Maybe it's me, even.\r\n\r\nI'm recording parts for a Let's Play from my iPad, when about 75% into it, the iPad fills up completely. No more recording parts.\r\n\r\nSo I decide to stop playing the game and upload a few more parts. Problem is, the videos won't upload completely, only getting, say, 19 minutes out of the full 36 minutes onto YouTube. The rest is missing with no explanation why.\r\n\r\nAnother option: email the videos to myself. Problem is, videos are too long and need to be trimmed. Which I really can't do, since it's constant gameplay and commentary with no solid pauses anywhere in between.\r\n\r\nYet another option: connect my iPad to my Mac. And I run into yet another problem: the iPad is too full to get the files off of. Or something like that. Whatever it tells me, it won't allow me to get the files from my iPad onto the Mac. I really don't get what it's telling me, nor do I understand how that or anything similar to that could possibly be an issue.\r\n\r\nOption #4: lower the quality of the video in the hopes that it will somehow affect the video's ability to upload fully. I'm not sure if this works yet, I'm currently testing this theory. But I'm pretty reluctant to upload videos in 360p as opposed to 720p, as they don't look very great at all anyways. They're basically me pointing an iPad directly at a TV screen and recording the results.\r\n\r\nThe other option that I really don't want to do: delete videos to free data space on my iPad. This means starting parts of (or possibly the entire) LP over again. It's not TOO much of an issue if I delete the last 3 or so parts, as that's where I start a new section of the game (I'm playing Sonic Heroes if you're wondering, and it filled up halfway through Team Chaotix's story). But that means I'll have to go back and re-record nearly 1.5 hours' worth of gameplay. Which kinda sucks.\r\n\r\n*rant over*","author":"9ba2e84e636164642cc03200"},{"id":"543f071f6368722dfb840100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@EHAN\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/543f05eb6368722ca1d30000#post_543f05eb6368722ca1d30000\r\nthis is more then likely more of youtubes hard bullcrap.\r\n\r\nPeople have said that Youtube is super weird when it comes to uploading.
