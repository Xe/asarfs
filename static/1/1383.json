But if it's about positivism, teachers usually ask each author's most prominent theories and why they affected the way law and his role in society was affected. Usually.\r\n\r\nSome tend to ask the most important of  their philosophies.\r\n\r\nIt gets easier when you know what they all have in common (Mostly that law is born from a constitutionally established organ and that's what gives law their validation and power) Some propose it in a different light and there are obviously key differences, but at their core, it's all about where law comes and what either internal or external factors it affects in a society or individual.","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"5401501e6368725d71d00000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"Applejack Rides a Balloon to Space\":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic0yaEr3z3s#t=35","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"540150896368720560c40100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"i didint know the money money money was a sample from abba ","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"5401516d6368724b02190000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I think I've found a new form of trolling: tonight I've been wasting my time on the internet by being absurdly nice to extremely angry people.
