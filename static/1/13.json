They're both good games.  Personally I like the speeches from bioshock 1 more.  The speeches about, \"A man chooses, a slave obeys\" and pretty much everything about ryan and such is so good.  Also the slogan of, \"No gods or kings.  Only man\" are so good.\r\n\r\nIn infinite you're pretty much going, \"Fuck comstock\" throughout the game.
