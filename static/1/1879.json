It made me wonder if there was an actual way around it, and I figured one out, there was an old Winchester model 1887 I think, which fired a cartridge which didn't went out of use in the 1940s. So a repeating rifle, which is older than 1911 and is using only an extremely outdated and no longer commercially available cartridge, would that be legal to own? \r\nAustralia's Antique firearms laws shouldn't technically have an issue with that, and if they do, okay, I'll go even bloody even more outdated and pick a single shot bolt action rifle.
