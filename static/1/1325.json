What I mean by this is that have you ever played a really good video game and then a studio creates a anime based off it only for it to be shit?  That's why he keep saying no to the studios.\r\n[/bq]\r\n\r\nSo... is just because the creator is afraid? Huh,I don't get it. If they could make a manga...correction, four mangas and *a novel*, then why not an anime adaptation of that mangas and/or novel? If the novel and mangas are good, then thete is not a problem with that, right? Like, there is a hundred thousand of good animes that were adapted from the mangas and/or novels. And I only know two two animes based on video games, the Devil May Cry anime, and one about soccer, Inazuma Eleven. The last one is very popular, and the manga and anime adaptation are very well done, IMO.\r\n\r\n>*You know how the resident evil live action movies are shit?  That's what the creator is worried of happening.*\r\n\r\nDude... we are talking about *anime* in *Japan*, not *live action movies* in *America*. Tecnically, every videogame adaptation made in america are shit, so why the creator is afraid? Touhou is in Japan. Also, Resident Evil have two movies made in *Japan*, and are good and very well done.\r\n\r\nAfraid?
