Saving a kid from a burning building is not going to unbomb a city full of innocent people. Giving money to the poor is not going to free a country for an evil dictator. The fact that these things happen even if relatively rare is still enough to justify scorn for humanity.\r\n\r\nAlso most people here think war is cool, which makes me sick to my stomach.
