It would make the decision more heart-gripping and tense rather than Aunt May taking the bullet. Also, in One More Day, May is willing to *accept* her fate rather than her pleading that she didn't want to die. On top of that, Quesada was willing to erase 20 years of history while JMS, the editor of the book, wanted to wipe out 30 years, including the Clone Saga.","author":"513e68eda4c72d4e3b000164"},{"id":"542824d66368720befde0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Here's some news: more and more police officers are having to wear cameras.  While one out of forty in the usa doesn't sound like a lot, five years ago very few police officers wore them.\r\n\r\nPersonally I support having police officers wear cameras because even though it's not perfect it does reduce the chance of conflict from either the suspect or police officer by a massive amount.\r\n\r\nInb4 someone argues that the least likely event to happen is the most likely event to happen, as in someone arguing that cause there's a one a million chance that a police officer accidentally detains a woman giving birth and on her way to the hospital that because of the new cameras we'll have a epidemic of women giving birth in prison.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54283758636872274b110100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/542824d66368720befde0100#post_542824d66368720befde0100\r\nI'm agreed with you on this.

Damn. \r\n\r\nAlso, I got to ask, but how does time move in Marvel? I'm seriously lost there, because they said that time slides, rather than just moves forwards thanks to the speed of which comics are published. Apparently the year at this point in Marvel despite us being in 2014-near 2015, its around 2004 or 2005. But they make references to elections in 2008 and so forth, and then there are gaps in time which no one explains, like Dark Reign was supposedly going for a period of a year, and it ends up only around 2 or 3 months. That there is what I'm baffled at, how the heck do they know what date it is when there are three different comics stating different times?
