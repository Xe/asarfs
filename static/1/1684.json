Though the episode with Zecora does show that they don't know much about other cultures of their world. \r\n\r\nHaving humanity flood through may cause an actual racial issue to arise, maybe. Or maybe we'd just integrate rapidly, I'd like to see how they react to learning about all our wonderful religions and what they can offer, or demand of the alien horse/human fusions. \r\n\r\nI don't think Christians would particularly receive Luna and Celestia with open arms.
