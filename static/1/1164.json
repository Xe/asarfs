The reason why these people are idiots is that it promotes what I like to call \"durr hurr I read the book so I r teh smarts\".  To use a analogy one person I know in the class is in data forensics and I asked him one day essentially \"Yo; why not use pattern recognition to predict crimes\" and he gave me a look of durr hurr failing to recognize what higher brain functions were.  What I mean by this is let's say a criminal commits burglary at 1am in the first house on a street; next night he commits burglary at 1am at the second house on the street; there's a high chances he's going to commit burglary at the third house on the street.  If all you know is how to read a book then that's literally all you know; if all you know is what a book says then you're not getting anything out of it really.  If the sole thing you took out of math class was that 2+2=4 and didn't use any level of brain function to realize the patter than to that person 3+3 would equal 4 still.\r\n\r\nTl:dr; people need to learn to use their fecking brain.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53e97bdc6368725290a00000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53e9786b63687265c6880100#post_53e9786b63687265c6880100\r\nYou mean to tell me your professors are supposed to teach?
