It's not whether or not you have anything, but what you use it for.  At the end of the day materialistic possessions and money are just tools.  Tools are meant to be used.  You can be the wealthiest person on the planet and if you don't use the tools given to you to in some manner bring back something to people then you're a drain on the economy.  Amassing wealth is nothing more than a drain on the economy and if you do that you're just a drain on society no matter the amount of money or possessions you acquire.  If anything having wealth makes you a leech to everyone else cause there are far better uses for wealth than just collecting things.\r\n\r\nTl:dr; it's called removing one's self from the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcquiring wealth no matter what and through any means is like the guy that steals everyone's lunches at work.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5337a07c6368722e94520000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5337a0016368724e21750100#post_5337a0016368724e21750100\r\n\r\ni cant be happy withouth videogames, literally i cant, nothing else makes me as happy.","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"5337a4776368721bfc3b0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@twistedmetalero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5337a07c6368722e94520000#post_5337a07c6368722e94520000\r\n[bq=\"twistedmetalero\"]\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5337a0016368724e21750100#post_5337a0016368724e21750100\r\n\r\ni cant be happy withouth videogames, literally i cant, *nothing else makes me as happy.*[/bq]\r\nThat doesn't sound like something someone who is actually happy would say.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5337a6366368723fee4f0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5337a4776368721bfc3b0000#post_5337a4776368721bfc3b0000\r\n\r\nthen im not happy i guess.\r\n\r\ni watch tv a lot too, sometimes i read, but its not nearly as fun as playing a videogame.","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"5337a66f6368723fee7f0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@twistedmetalero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53379d506368722bd3d80000#post_53379d506368722bd3d80000\r\n\r\n...I just wanted the burger, actually. :P","author":"5041b54f7f123b77af00a442"},{"id":"5337a6906368725565460000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@And Brother I Hurt People\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5337a66f6368723fee7f0000#post_5337a66f6368723fee7f0000\r\n\r\nda burgah froma  happy meal.\r\n\r\nthat only makes me question you more.","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"5337a6e16368725476610000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@twistedmetalero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5337a6906368725565460000#post_5337a6906368725565460000\r\n\r\nBecause I don't like eating huge McDonald burgers, and if I get a happy meal one, it's smaller.
