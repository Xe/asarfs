(The Stuff at cons was inexcusable though.)\r\n\r\nIt's a good thing my perceptions were never tainted like yours were. Because I don't know how I would go about my day without some Pokemon fetish porn. (And FA is the only site that mostly doesn't care for humans that I can think of)[/bq]\r\nI'm going to say something massively unpopular, *BUT* the stereotypes against furries is 100% justified.  I know that most furries are okay and that nowadays their sites and cons are nothing like what they used to be *BUT* as someone that was around back when FA had just popped on the scene you know how there's all those stereotypes?  People used to actually do that shit and would threaten to stab anyone that said anything against them under the \"Judge not your fellow furs\".  Like one year at anthrocon a woman was raped and went to the police; you know what happened?  Because the person that raped her was popular furries threatened to bomb her house/kill her/rape her again saying that it would be \"funny\" to rape her again.\r\n\r\nThere used to be some serious motherfucking shit that used to go on.\r\n\r\n\r\nObviously no one puts up with this shit anymore, but it massively left a metaphorical sour taste in my mouth.\r\n\r\nIf I had to summarize the difference between 2014 furries and say 2001 furries is that 2014 people don't put up with this shit anymore.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53f124d76368723ccab00000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53f124156368723d39b90000#post_53f124156368723d39b90000\r\nI just like how Bronies were cool enough to not make any \"counter-hate\" art towards Furries.\r\n\r\nThe amount of anti-Pony art made by people outside our circle heavily outweighs any \"hate art\" our fandom has ever produced against them.","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"53f124ef63687228328c0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53f124156368723d39b90000#post_53f124156368723d39b90000\r\n[bq=\"trashboat\"]\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53f120826368723d533c0000#post_53f120826368723d533c0000\r\nAnd besides, Those nuts were probably a Vocal minority.[/bq]\r\nI don't subscribe to the \"Most of them were huge nuts back then\" Theory, The Loud ones are always more noticeable than everyone else.","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"53f1254363687262c7350000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SeraphimDawn\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53f124306368725d4b920100#post_53f124306368725d4b920100\r\nThey definitely were.

In fact, some of my buddies here are Furries too.\r\n\r\nThe thing I hate about Furaffinity is that how too many artists appear to be too overprotective and stingy over their contents to a point they wouldn't even let any unregistered users view them. I don't get the point of that. Why post your art publicly where pseudo-anonymous _registered_ usercan just steal them as long as they are able to view them?

You don't have a danmaku of renamon and think that she's over rated?!  I'll stab you in the fucking throat while you're asleep and rape your corpse\".  I'm just going to straight up admit it I don't want nothing to do with the furry fandom cause there used to be a lot of racism, heterophobic and sexist hate on the sites early 2000's.  What I mean by this is back in the day your average furry site/con or shit was pretty much, \"You 'breeders'(derogatory term for straight people)/women/minorities are ruining the fandom!  I'll stab you in the fucking throat!  FURRY PRIDE!\"\r\n\r\nI know cons and sites are no longer like this anymore and that con staff and site owners have massively cracked down on this sort of behavior but there is no way in the everliving hell I'm ever going to a con or interacting with furries to any level because of the shit I've seen.  Why?  Cause simply put while I'm talking about the furry fandom here right now I'm talking about the internet and all fandoms actually threatening to kill someone because of their race/sex/sexuality or threatening to kill someone over cartoon characters is massively unacceptable behavior and some times you have to put on your big boy pants, act like a adult and *NOT* threaten to kill someone in their sleep like a psychopath.[/bq]\r\nThese behaviors are mostly driven by overinflated ego, and the lack of sense of consequences along with a perceived sense of safety behind a computer screen. Which is also the main reason why rowdy 4Chan and Tumblr user do the shit they do.\r\n\r\nAs for Furries. Just stay away from those who try to live like their Fursona animals.","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"53f12b416368725e23af0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SeraphimDawn\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53f129dd63687219328b0100#post_53f129dd63687219328b0100\r\nI believe the images shown aren't the ones you cant see. \r\n\r\nI think?
