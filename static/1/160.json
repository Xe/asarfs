That test would make it possible to ban any paper or any journal or magazine in some benighted place. The First Amendment was designed 'to invite dispute,' to induce 'a condition of unrest,' to 'create dissatisfaction with conditions as they are,' and even to stir 'people to anger.' The idea that the First Amendment permits punishment for ideas that are 'offensive' to the particular judge or jury sitting in judgment is astounding. No greater leveler of speech or literature has ever been designed. To give the power to the censor, as we do today, is to make a sharp and radical break with the traditions of a free society. The First Amendment was not fashioned as a vehicle for dispensing tranquilizers to the people. Its prime function was to keep debate open to 'offensive' as well as to 'staid' people. The tendency throughout history has been to subdue the individual and to exalt the power of government. The use of the standard 'offensive' gives authority to government that cuts the very vitals out of the First Amendment. As is intimated by the Court's opinion, the materials before us may be garbage. But so is much of what is said in political campaigns, in the daily press, on TV, or over the radio. By reason of the First Amendment—and solely because of it—speakers and publishers have not been threatened or subdued because their thoughts and ideas may be 'offensive' to some.\"","author":"5010fa077f123b1e4f00104e"},{"id":"535204786368723266110000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"So was Raiden's kid ever shown?","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"535204dc6368720236ad0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I have been wanting to collect some more _Jurassic Park_ toys.

I don't mean stupid as in the logic behind it is stupid, rather groups like the nsa can't even catch a single terrorist, how the fuck do people expect groups you pump billions of dollars into to effectively censor the internet when they're completely ineffective?\r\n\r\nCurrent surveillance programs do *NOT* work at their intended use.  What I mean by this is that the way current programs work is essentially a reverse google search engine by storing information and using key phrases to sift through and to list potential threats.\r\n\r\nImmediate problems to internet censorship:\r\nRelies on faulty programming logic.\r\nUses key phrases and you'd have better luck searching google.\r\nNo one is that stupid. . okay some people are that stupid, but the majority of individuals a government or such are trying to censor/watch know better.\r\nThe way the programs search for potential \"threats\" is fucking retarded.\r\nActual threats don't post their stuff on the web.  After the snowden leak happened all actual threats immediately stopped using the net for relaying information.\r\nIf actual threats are no longer using the internet in any fashion then how do you plan on finding them?\r\nDue to moore's law and that every year the amount of information transferred through the internet is increasing as time goes on these completely ineffective programs will exponentially become more and more broken due to crappy programming.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe truth is the vast majority of organizations meant to spy on people are led by incompetent people; the people that are actually programming the software are probably all either playing tf2 on their work computer or looking at porn and occasionally when the boss comes by switch it to a screensaver of a video they took earlier of writing fake code that their bosses can't understand.  It's probably in binary too and probably translates out to something along the lines of, \"my boss is a fucking idiot\" or something.\r\n\r\nThe nsa since it's inception has caught 0 terrorists; all the actual terrorists caught the last decade were either caught by the fbi or the military or the cia.\r\n\r\nTl:dr; the nsa is nothing more than a ineffective reactionary department that was made in a rush after a national even that since then has produce no results and is a waste of money.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53520b846368723f806c0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5352076f6368725f8a640000#post_5352076f6368725f8a640000\r\nI think it's just an excuse for perverted government officials to hack into webcams and see girls undressing, as well as to \"shoplift\" camwhoring services.","author":"50b70eeb7f123b1a02000097"},{"id":"53520bd96368723f80950000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Randomosaur\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53520b846368723f806c0000#post_53520b846368723f806c0000\r\nProbably.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53520c13636872563b230000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53520bd96368723f80950000#post_53520bd96368723f80950000\r\nIf it's true, I would actually like to do stuff like that.
