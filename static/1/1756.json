Wonder when the ride's gonna end.[/bq]\r\nI have to disagree here; I have to go take care of something so I'll make it quick; essentially what will happen is that anime in mainstream western culture will follow a bell curve where it'll reach the point where 24/7 news is complaining about anime being too popular, complaining about how \"too many\" people cosplay and the like then it'll eventually die down when it just becomes another part of mainstream culture.  Basically to use a analogy you know how like LoL is so popular in Korea that even politicians cosplay as the characters?  That level of popularity will be achieved, but then it'll die down when whatever the next big thing culture wise comes along.\r\n\r\nTl:dr; anime is the new big thing in mainstream western culture then ten years from now something else will be the next new big thing then something else will be the next new big thing.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"542b2b9f63687206d4730000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/542b2b516368721abf590000#post_542b2b516368721abf590000\r\nWhat made you think that I was serious?

It feels like anime is being marketed solely based on the fact that it's got a much different feel to it than what Westerners are used too. Once its use is oversaturated, it'll fade away for the next \"new\" thing.\r\n\r\nThen again, the first generation of weaboos have started to make media. Look at some of the art influences in today's cartoons and, well, music videos. So who knows, maybe you're right. Only time will tell.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I think it would be great if this \"nerd pride\" in general stuck around.","author":"5041b54f7f123b77af00a442"},{"id":"542b2dba6368721ae49e0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"*starts peeking trough a hole*\r\n\r\nIs it safe?","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"542b2ecb6368727ec92b0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"We are working to work till like 6:00-6:30 pm today\r\nEck","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"542b2eed6368727dc1630000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@And Brother I Hurt People\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/542b2cb86368724d372a0000#post_542b2cb86368724d372a0000\r\nTrust me I never knew it was even possible either.\r\n\r\nBut look at me now! \r\n\r\n\r\n\"@twistedmetalero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/542b2dba6368721ae49e0000#post_542b2dba6368721ae49e0000\r\nSafer then it'll ever be mate.
