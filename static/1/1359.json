XD\r\n\r\nHonestly I love Phoenix Wright but I have never played any of the games and every time, _*everytime*_, I try to watch a walkthrough I end up forgetting to continue or I find something else to watch and it makes me mad because I know the Ace Attorney games are good!\r\n\r\nIt's just that they require a lot of reading and some of the walkthrouers go through the text really fast or I read to slow. \r\n\r\n~^And I guess I should blame my low attention span as well I suppose.^~\r\n\r\nBut by all means, play the games! like I said, I _know_ their good!
