Even static objects can move. But, anything that's as big as a car will not be affected by it. It also has a short range.\r\n\r\nTrivium: A stand that can split three knight-like figures work in perfect synchronization and only one is the real thing, but it has rather lackluster defence. It makes up for it with it's great attack and range.\r\n\r\nFFDP: It only has one arm with a fingerless hand. The fingers grow over time and when there's five of them, instant death is ensured if the punch is landed on the stand or user. It also can tank well but it takes about 25 minutes to get to full strength.","author":"513e68eda4c72d4e3b000164"},{"id":"54125f8763687242a86e0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54125c1f636872660eb60000#post_54125c1f636872660eb60000\r\nI want to see your Ultraman fighting with this thing\r\n!http://fc04.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2012/262/4/7/red_by_lucratanexarii_by_genocyber-d5f8092.jpg!","author":"31bee2686368722a0df23600"},{"id":"54125fe563687242a8930000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"i'm playing dead space now\r\ngonna watch jojo at the same time","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"54125ff363687212975f0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Gizoid101\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54125f8763687242a86e0000#post_54125f8763687242a86e0000\r\nSeven?\r\n\r\nOn one hand, Seven has the Eye slugger\r\n!http://38.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mb3pudE9ph1rbhnqko1_400.gif!\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, He's fighting Red.","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"5412604863687227820f0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Just watched \"The Frollo Show\" last night.
