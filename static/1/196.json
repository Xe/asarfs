Sure that works right now cause only under a dozen or so congressmen get replaced every election on average(Sorry republicans/democrats if you think you're getting a super majority in 2014 you're a idiot), but if you have to replace the vast majority of congress with plants in a short time you're not going to be as effective.\r\n\r\nSure there's going to be plenty of corrupt congressmen in two decades, but not nearly as many as we have because the current tactics only work cause congress right now has such a low turnaround.  If you're a lobbyist group then you better get your checkbook extremely ready cause you're going to need it badly soon.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"}]}
