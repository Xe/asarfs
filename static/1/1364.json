She goes into the bathroom. There's two small children zipping around, and their mother is completely ignoring them, on her phone or something. My mom comes out of her stall when she hears \"I dare you to lick the toilet\". And one of the boys is actually on his hands and knees, _about to do it._ My mom looks at him, and simply says \"don't.\" The mother of these kids turns around and says \"Don't tell my children what to do!\" My mom, of course, responds with \"Your children were about to lick a _toilet._\" What's the other woman's response? \"Who do you think you are?\"\r\n\r\nPeople are ingrates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"@Shadow_the_Hedgehog\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5400dadf6368720269330000#post_5400dadf6368720269330000\r\n\r\nOh, yeah.
