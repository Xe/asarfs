Derived from the term Weeaboo (referring to a person overly obsessed with japan.) A Wolfaboo: “A person overly obsessed with wolves; one who equates a human life to that of a wolf; someone who defends and or glorifies wolves killing humans. Often misspelling the plural of wolf as ‘wolfs’; Often, will make up lies and propaganda to defend wolves; most of the lies do not hold true when put to actual research.”\r\nTom: “Did you see how Yellowstone is regulating the wolves to preserve elk populations?”\r\nBob: “YEAH! IT MAKES ME SO MAD! IF A HUNTER KILLS ANY WOLFS, THEN THAT HUNTER SHOULD BE RIPPED APART BY A WHOLE WOLF PACK!!”\r\nTom: “Wow, you never told me what a wolfaboo you were.”\r\n\r\nalso\r\n!http://i40.mangareader.net/wolf-guy-ookami-no-monshou/22/wolf-guy-ookami-no-monshou-949614.jpg!\r\n!http://i8.mangareader.net/wolf-guy-ookami-no-monshou/22/wolf-guy-ookami-no-monshou-949616.jpg!\r\n!http://i40.mangareader.net/wolf-guy-ookami-no-monshou/22/wolf-guy-ookami-no-monshou-949617.jpg!\r\n!http://i23.mangareader.net/wolf-guy-ookami-no-monshou/22/wolf-guy-ookami-no-monshou-949618.jpg!\r\n!http://i15.mangareader.net/wolf-guy-ookami-no-monshou/22/wolf-guy-ookami-no-monshou-949619.jpg!\r\n!http://i18.mangareader.net/wolf-guy-ookami-no-monshou/22/wolf-guy-ookami-no-monshou-949621.jpg!\r\n!http://i26.mangareader.net/wolf-guy-ookami-no-monshou/22/wolf-guy-ookami-no-monshou-949622.jpg!","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"5430475c63687258fc910100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\r\n!toyfair.bandai.com/assets/webimages-sprukits-L01-02.jpg!\r\n_this thing has an adorable floofy wolf tail_","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"54304797636872748b170100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@twistedmetalero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5430422c636872748b2f0000#post_5430422c636872748b2f0000\r\nAnd then he transforms into a wolf.","author":"505696b47f123b37e800effa"},{"id":"543047cf636872547bbb0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@igotnopicks\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54304797636872748b170100#post_54304797636872748b170100\r\nThe end.","author":"5056c9e87f123b37f6012a34"},{"id":"543047d0636872712f7b0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BzGvl-fIIAAm_XP.jpg:large!\r\n\r\noh the stereotypes are real","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"543048ef6368727158ac0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@twistedmetalero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/543047d0636872712f7b0100#post_543047d0636872712f7b0100\r\nThat has to be the most ghetto thing possible.\r\n[spoiler]I'm sorry[/spoiler]","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"5430568b63687248e6800000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Friends taking my family out for lunch.\r\nCya.","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"5430599863687259b1140100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I think I just realized what the next big shitstorm culturally that we're probably going to hear about soon will be, basically you know how every decade or so there's one really big thing that is a massively divisive issue; well I thought of what's going to be the next one: ethnic plastic surgery.
