One penny for every dime. After days turned to weeks turned to months, he finally goes a full year of stealing one penny for every dime he earns.\r\n\r\n\"This is splendid!\" His wife cheers. \"With this money, we can by a new TV!\"\r\n\r\nThey immediately go out to do so. After buying the TV, his wife gets an idea.\r\n\r\n\"Now you should steal not one, but two pennies for every dime you make.\"\r\n\r\nSo, he does exactly that. Not one, but two pennies for every dime. After days turned to weeks turned to months, he finally goes a full year of stealing not one, but two pennies for every dime he earns.\r\n\r\n\"This is sensational!\" His wife cheers. \"With this money, we can by a new car!\"\r\n\r\nThey immediately go out to do so. After buying the car, his wife gets an idea.\r\n\r\n\"Now you should steal not one, not two, but three pennies for every dime you make!\"\r\n\r\nSo, he does exactly that. Not one, not two, but three pennies for every dime. After days turned to weeks turned to months, he finally goes a full year of stealing not one, not two, but three pennies for every dime he earns.\r\n\r\n\"This is spectacular!\" His wife cheers. \"With this money, we can by a new house!\"\r\n\r\nThey immediately go out to do so. After buying the house, his wife gets an idea.\r\n\r\n\"Now you should steal not one, not two, not three, but four pennies for every dime you make!\"\r\n\r\nSo, he does exactly that. Not one, not two, not three, but four pennies for every dime. After days turned to weeks turned to months, he finally goes a full year of stealing not one, not two, not three, but four pennies for every dime he earns.\r\n\r\n\"This is stupendous!\" His wife cheers. \"With this money, we can buy a mansion!\"\r\n\r\nThey immediately go out to do so. After buying the mansion, his wife gets an idea.\r\n\r\n\"Now you should steal not one, not two, not three, not four, but five pennies for every dime you make!\"\r\n\r\nSo, he does exactly that. Not one, not two, not three, not four, but five pennies for every dime. After days turned to weeks turned to months, he finally goes a full year of stealing not one, not two, not three, not four but five pennies for every dime he earns.\r\n\r\n\"This is sacred!\" His wife cheers. \"With this money, we can buy our own resort!\"\r\n\r\nThey immediately go out to do so. After buying the resort, his wife gets an idea.\r\n\r\n\"Now you should steal not one, not two, not three, not four, not five, but six pennies for every dime you make!\"\r\n\r\nSo, he does exactly that. This facade goes on for many years without suspicion, him going several years stealing from his workplace without getting caught. Each year they would ascend in luxury and prosperity thanks to their bloating income, which increased twofold with every year. It seemed like it would never end…\r\n\r\n...but fate had other plans.\r\n\r\nAfter all those years, a fellow worker had caught him stealing not one, not two, not three, not four, not five, not six, not seven, not eight, not nine, but ten pennies for every dime he made. Realizing that the jig is up, he doesn't retaliate as the authorities take him away.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, you stand accused of stealing not one, not two, not three, not four, not five, not six, not seven, not eight, not nine, but ten pennies for every dime you've made for the last year. How do you stand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Guilty, your honor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course.
