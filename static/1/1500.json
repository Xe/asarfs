Why?  Cause essentially what this means is that inside a black hole you literally hit the end of the universe.  Basically Einsteing may be wrong.  However Steven Hawking theorized that there is no such thing as a black hole at all; rather all a black hole is a bunch of mass in a extremely small space with a \"apparent horizon\".
