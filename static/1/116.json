It rained a bit, so we came back for it to clean up (and so my stepmom can charge her phone). Then I was shown around the French Quarter by my dad and familiarized with Bourbon Street itself, all the way going to a few bars for a round or two at each before walking on to the next to walk off the drinks. Some minor discussion on what to do tomorrow and the rest of the few days I'm here, and a visit to the French Market for a hat, since I decided I needed something to keep the sun out of my eyes right now.\r\n\r\nFeet are tired, I'm hot and tired, and we're waiting to hit up a place that opens up only for dinner to eat. So far: a good start. Hoping that the next four days won't be all rain and thunder as predicted and we'll have some proper sunny windows to do fun things.\r\n\r\nAlso our Taxi driver from the airport to our corner of the French Quarter we're pretty sure was a insane driver. Like, one cartoon world away from being a character in Crazy Taxi.","author":"4fe4bf947f123b175b000001"},{"id":"533f326c6368726ea4c10200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@AaronMk\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/533f31e56368722b280b0000#post_533f31e56368722b280b0000\r\nAre they still cleaning up and rebuilding down there after Katrina or is everything back to normal?","author":"5010fa077f123b1e4f00104e"},{"id":"533f33136368722d665a0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@someguy111\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/533f326c6368726ea4c10200#post_533f326c6368726ea4c10200\r\n\r\nIt's all back to normal as far as I can tell and as far as my Dad pointed out.\r\n\r\nHe came down here after Katrina to help out in the clean up and repair work. So he has a post-disaster insight and even on the way to the hotel he pointed out how the bridge we were on was destroyed and how such-and-such sky-scrapers were stripped of their windows to so high up. And from what he said: it's certainly turned around and is rebuilt.\r\n\r\nThe French Quarter, where we're at, apparently only had two-inches of flood water, despite being four-five stories below sea level and the Mississippi.","author":"4fe4bf947f123b175b000001"},{"id":"533f36766368727d1d2a0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Alright, I just got out of the dentist, and they removed my wisdom teeth.
