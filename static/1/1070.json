It's a primal urge that cannot be silenced. No one really hates it, people who claim to do so are thinking they're too 'civilized' to partake in 'feral activities'. Rules of nature, pal. It's how we survived.","author":"52f0834d63687261cba90300"},{"id":"53dfa7d46368722063f60200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53dfa4ee63687210a14c0000#post_53dfa4ee63687210a14c0000\r\n\r\nI think it in part has to do with the fact that for a really long time, much of western civilization was christianized and Abrahamic values were ingrained into the culture. If I remember correctly, one of these values is no sex before marriage, which alot of media shows in some form. Obviously we're moving away from said values now and there's the opposition to the shift as there always is.\r\n\r\nAtleast that's my guess.","author":"500757fd7f123b75a90003b1"},{"id":"53dfa9576368720451760000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Shadow_the_Hedgehog\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53dfa0b6636872060fe50000#post_53dfa0b6636872060fe50000\r\nExactly, and they still do what they can.","author":"5056c9e87f123b37f6012a34"},{"id":"53dfa9c36368726969bb0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Princessâ™ Molestia\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53dfa7d46368722063f60200#post_53dfa7d46368722063f60200\r\nThe problem with that though is that plenty of non-Christian civilizations also take a fairly dim view on sexual activity. Specifically though, they take a dim view on the _wrong_ sort of sexual activity- usually, that activity is _anything_ that doesn't result in the birth of a child.\r\n\r\nThat I think is more of a leftover from the days when humans still lived in tribes, and had to fight against one another for resources. Since the survival of the tribe took importance over everything else, any sort of sex that didn't result in the creation of good little soldiers to fight in future wars for you was probably frowned upon fairly heavily.","author":"5043cdb47f123b72cc0032d3"},{"id":"53dfab8d6368726477180000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Silent_Witness\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53dfa9c36368726969bb0000#post_53dfa9c36368726969bb0000\r\nHm.
