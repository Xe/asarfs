Western cgi anime?\r\n*dodges bullet*\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I mean by this is that there have been some major attempts at bringing anime to the west but for the most part they've failed because they try to hard pretend to be something it's not.  It's like trying to watch someone with a southern USA accent and that's Caucasian trying to fool us into making us believe they're from Japan.  Avatar and Legend of Korra are damn good shows cause they know rather than be something they're not they focus on being good instead.\r\n\r\nCGI anime holds potential cause it's cheaper.  I have seen good cgi anime before, but the problem that the west has and a lot of companies have is they try to force it into a animation show; if you put cgi in a animated show it's going to be obvious and it's going to look fucking hideous.  If you made a entirely cgi anime it would look better than if you had a cgi/animated show.  RWBY may not be the super best looking but considering that it's being made by a very small company it's pretty damn impressive.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53ed29b56368722aa6f00000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53ed295963687277a00d0000#post_53ed295963687277a00d0000\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nIS YOU GRANDPA YAMAMOTO??\r\n\r\n","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"53ed2a0b6368720e470b0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53ed296b63687275f6f50100#post_53ed296b63687275f6f50100\r\nYep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"@QuasarNova\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53ed29b56368722aa6f00000#post_53ed29b56368722aa6f00000\r\nPretty much!
