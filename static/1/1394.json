What I mean by this is that is that a lot of people that say they want the world to be a better place don't actually mean it in that so long as things are terrible they still have a reason to strive for being a better person in that there exists a mindset in which a individual will not to cure a patient cause so long as a patient is sick they will have a income.  You already know about individuals that want to help others to prove they are superior and individuals that want to be rewarded.  The more logical fallacies that a individual has to jump through the less and less likely they are to be actually a good person.\r\n\r\nWhen you get down to it there's two types of good people: individuals who truly with to help others and those who wish to be good and wish to truly believe in helping others.  While the later sort of person is a fraud I have to say they have more value because it takes a conscious effort to be a good person despite not already being a good person.\r\n\r\nThe sad thing is that when you get right down to it the villain is the hero of his own story in that the reason why there's so many problems in the world isn't that there's some embodiment of evil in the world rather that individuals wish to be rewarded for their actions or prove they're right rather than wishing to improve the standard of living of other individuals or not wishing to become a individual that wishes to improve the standard of living for others.  To use analogy a fake diamond has no imperfections cause it takes a deliberate act of trying to reach perfection whereas a real diamond has imperfections in it even though a real diamond is worth more and individuals that are trying to prove they're right/people that want to be rewarded are like a person cutting a piece of glass into the shape of a diamond then trying to pass of as one and selling it in a dark alley from someone wearing a trench-coat.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54039e5463687215553e0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54039cf7636872214a2d0200#post_54039cf7636872214a2d0200\r\n\"uc9, be my pal.
