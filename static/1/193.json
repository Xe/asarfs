We're talking hundreds of computers and potentially thousands.  If you knew what year it was made it would drastically help trying to find it, but since it's a refurbished computer you're absolutely shit out of luck.\r\n\r\nThe only option you have is to either spend hours visually looking through every model asus has ever made or take it to a computer repair store and tell them the bios is corrupted.  If you take it to a repair store ask him to tell you what model it is and *NEVER* forget what model it is; tattoo it on your hand if you need to cause this problem could be fixed literally in one minute if you had the model number.\r\n\r\nLast time my bios got corrupted it took me five seconds to input the internet wifi password, 20 seconds to find the website, 5 seconds to download the bios files, 5 seconds to put it on a thumb drive, 30 seconds to follow the steps.\r\n\r\nIf I could help I would, but this is the equivalent of someone needing a new ignition coil for a car, but not having the car model or any information other about the car than it's a ford and having to visually look through thousands of ignition coils to see which one it is.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"535b74516368723e17e30000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/535b6b3a6368723df2230200#post_535b6b3a6368723df2230200\r\n\r\nAh fuck it, none of them have the startup button in the middle.\r\n\r\nIll take it to a professional.\r\n\r\nAsus pc look so alike its hard to know the original from your refurbished pc","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"535c1fb26368725655250000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Hey I just thought of something, while I'm not sure if it belongs here or in another thread it's more of economics than the other thread; you know the people that never shut the hell up about \"decline of morality\"?
