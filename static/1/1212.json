What I mean by this is that obviously humans will always be needed at some level for certain jobs and such to which we're talking a long time time until AI and robots reach the point at which they can fully and totally 100% replace humans.  Rather what I mean by this is chances are they're going to take over the business world.  Let's say a android has the intelligence of a human; simply put humans as CEO's and business owners would not be able to compete.  Humans running a business need to sign paperwork, go to meetings, tell their subordinates what to do and then go through fifty steps before every actually doing anything.  A AI boss on the other hand could just plug into a computer and done.  If there ever is to be a robot uprising it would be them taking control away from humans for the CEO positions at companies.  Which honestly I can't say is a bad thing because a lot of times CEO's do dumb shit that collapse companies; having a AI boss instead would mean far more financially stable companies.  Chances are humans would lose control over the financial world and by proxy lose a lot of power, but Idunno considering how the very basis of the reason why financial crashes exist is because of a person doing something stupid having a chain reaction maybe that would actually be a good thing.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53eef34b63687267d9920100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Silent_Witness\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53eef1fb6368727ce36c0000#post_53eef1fb6368727ce36c0000\r\nTrue, but porn is my catnip.

Also, like other videogame movies, Hollywood will change a lot of things just to make the movie more dramatic, like, how the 4 kids disappear, the others security guards, and the question of how your partner from the phone knows what the mechanical things are capable of, but still he sounds like he doesn't about your life.","author":"5239db6da4c72d22d9000358"},{"id":"53eef47e6368721840650000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@gasmaskangel\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53eef34b63687267d9920100#post_53eef34b63687267d9920100\r\nIs that why you're so good at writing it?","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"53eef588636872466b3c0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I really need to go back to Kaikoura, but I probably have to wait another year.","author":"50b70eeb7f123b1a02000097"},{"id":"53eef5916368727987f60000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Shadow_the_Hedgehog\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53eef45f6368727d5fe30000#post_53eef45f6368727d5fe30000\r\n\r\nthe bay did the recorded genre thing and nobody complained about it.","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"53eef59363687217b0b80000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Update on ISIS:\r\nWell it's apparent how this shit's going to resolve itself.
