What this is artificial wombs outside the human body.  Basically in 20 years child birth will be a thing of the past and instead children born in artificial wombs.\r\n\r\nWhy this is good:\r\nWould prevent many disease from being passed onto children and prevent many things from negatively effecting children and as well as boost health of children and increase lifespans.\r\n\r\nInb4 \"it's not natural\" vs \"#iamenlightened\" debate.\r\n\r\nAnother reason why this is good news is that it would allow for couples that normally couldn't have children to have children and even gay couples to have children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso apparently the internet is still in it's infancy; what I mean by this isn't that some technologies coming out in the next decade will be far greater than the internet in of itself.  What I mean by this is that you know how people are excited about how the internet has changed the world and how virtual reality is to do so soon too?  Well apparently there's a couple things; basically with the number of cool shit coming out in the next decade or so thirty years from now our entire world culture and society will be unrecognizable to anything we currently understand of how cultures work now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso apparently star trek is coming sooner rather than later; no I don't mean warp space; rather I mean that we're just now learning how technological advances effect the economics to it's full extent.  What I mean by this is that by twenty years from now the entire minimum wage sector will for the most part be replaced by machines and so will factories.  Basically you know how people complain about robots taking people's jobs?  Totally true actually.  In twenty or so years everything from factory floor workers, janitors, cashiers, farmers, surgeons, bankers, aircraft pilots, cars and even your mail will be completely automatized.\r\n\r\nWhy?  Cause as technology increases the costs for machinery to do the work of humans decreases; in twenty years why pay a person $20,000 a year when you can have a $100 robot do the same amount of work?\r\n\r\nHow many jobs are we talking about being eliminated?  Honestly no one knows; all anyone really knows is a metric fuck ton.  \"How can we stop this?\"  There's no real way to stop it at this point; companies that automatize the work force will reduce costs of production and thus experience ever greater increases in profit; there's no way to compete.  \"What's going to happen to the world?\"  No one knows.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53e54d8f6368727ab0c60000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Guess what I just saw...","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"53e54eb863687206f0700100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53e54d8f6368727ab0c60000#post_53e54d8f6368727ab0c60000\r\n\r\nShrek?","author":"5239db6da4c72d22d9000358"},{"id":"53e54ed36368722d213c0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53e54d8f6368727ab0c60000#post_53e54d8f6368727ab0c60000\r\n\r\na recently released movie.\r\naomething about some obscure as fuck anime.\r\nporn\r\nsomething obscure about vocaloid.","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"53e54ed96368724718a70000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Shadow_the_Hedgehog\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53e54eb863687206f0700100#post_53e54eb863687206f0700100\r\nClose.
