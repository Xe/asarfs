So a more compact lightweight gun is needed. That or a tank, but once again, I'm holding off on that for the moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"@Shadow_the_Hedgehog\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53d7c5936368725465690100#post_53d7c5936368725465690100\r\n\r\nUh dude, I'm talking about Earth ponies, not unicorns, Pegasi can use the weather, but that won't last forever, and they are vulnerable to AA guns I'm pretty sure they can't survive a wall of shrapnel.\r\n\r\nAs for unicorns, I'm pretty sure their power is limited to their level of skill and such, or bloodline wise. \r\n\r\nAlso a war fought between mortals is more important, especially when immortals have no place in it. Celestia and Luna might not agree, but it is being fought out by everyone else besides them for various reasons.
