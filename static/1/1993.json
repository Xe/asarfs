That's not a joke either.  Thank god the fandom had enough of their shit and cracked down on this around 2007/2008.  So yeah; there's a massive reason why so many people that like anthro don't want nothing to do with the actual fandom.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"544cd532636872582d890000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"DO NOT EVER EAT AN ENTIRE FIREY HAWAIIAN PIZZA FROM DOMINOS \r\nIT DOES BAD THINGS TO YOUR BODY\r\nI DON'T THINK I'LL EVER BE THE SAME AFTER TONIGHT ","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"544d1d566368725ccd1c0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/544cd532636872582d890000#post_544cd532636872582d890000\r\nSounds like a shitty idea.","author":"515ddf93a4c72d8a1f000d57"},{"id":"544d20e26368722d05020200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/544cd532636872582d890000#post_544cd532636872582d890000\r\nWhat did it do to you?\r\n\r\n\r\n\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/544cbcce636872562a6d0100#post_544cbcce636872562a6d0100\r\nI didn't exactly have a full understanding of what a Furry was before joining this Pony Fandom, other than people who appear to be fond of things with fur. For some reason, anime fandoms seems to have a common distaste towards anthro cartoon animals, judging by how the top images on Sankaku under each tag that DO contain high concentrations of Furry art tend to be dominated by whatever human art that are under the same tags. I was never really into Furry stuff, but I didn't exactly know why people hated them, other than how they break from the norms, until the shit I saw they threw at the Pony Fandom during the early days of our existence. Furries, ironically of all people to hate Bronies and MLP, despite being admittedly similar in culture and went through similar experience throughout their histories. Those death threats just because some artists simply want to make MLP art, and threats made just because FA wanted to place a temporary MLP inspired banner of FA. But I trust that those are just rowdy minorities who make too much noise. And I guess they were simply just tired of how our Pony stuff appeared everywhere. Yet, their Furry and Sonic stuff appear everywhere as well, much to the frustration of other fandoms out there.\r\n\r\nDon't worry, I am a friend with a few Furries on this site. And they are pleasant people. There is an artist I watch on FA, he seems like a cool guy.","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"544d25ac63687234d2fd0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/544cd532636872582d890000#post_544cd532636872582d890000\r\n\r\nits the grapes again isnt it?\r\n\r\ngoddam grapes take another innocent victim\r\n\r\n\"@SeraphimDawn\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/544d20e26368722d05020200#post_544d20e26368722d05020200\r\n\r\nalso the high amount of artist that draw both furry and mlp stuff.\r\n\r\nlike atryl and scappo","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"544d28a963687209b4270200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@twistedmetalero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/544d25ac63687234d2fd0000#post_544d25ac63687234d2fd0000\r\nThey're awesome artists.

Bluntwhiskey is also a talented artist, if you don't mind the censors she puts in her art for non-patrons.\r\nQuite frankly, Pony anthros are the only anthros I can get inbto.
