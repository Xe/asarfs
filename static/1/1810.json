Maybe it'll end up like the Soviet Union?\r\nA part of me believes that Tibet and Xinjiang would be better off under the administration of a democratic China rather than full independence. Hopefully under rules that respect their religions, peoples, and societies while having access to the economic and social benefits of Chinese citizens. And not be treated as second rate. I do not want them to separate.","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"542f981f63687232ca2b0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/542f93df63687238df670000#post_542f93df63687238df670000\r\nThe cynical part of me thinks the protestors want more than democracy, else why protest in HK which is the business capital and one of the more autonomous places in China","author":"4fe16df67f123b13e400003f"},{"id":"542f985763687213eb930000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/542f978b6368725536950000#post_542f978b6368725536950000\r\nYes, it may be.

They don't seem to respect sovereignty. Their foreign policies are significantly what makes the world hate the US. As seen in Iraq and Japan(during the early postwar era).
