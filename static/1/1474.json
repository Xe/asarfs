You have never seen these spiders. They are highly train operatives for... well... that's really not important right now, is it?\r\n\r\nYou see the spiders are very worried for you. They're worried about all the things you don't see, which are themselves the consequences of things you don't know that you do.\r\n\r\nDid you know that after you fall asleep you wander into one certain room of your house and go to one certain secret spot and take out a very certain bronze amulet?\r\n\r\nYou do. Every night, sometime after you've drifted off into the peaceful oblivion of sleep, and you never see the thing you called in those awful rituals.\r\n\r\nWell... things really. You never see them, and this worries the spiders a great deal.\r\n\r\nYou never see the pale, damp skin or the black mouths dripping with bile. You never see the hands with mouths in them, or the terrible, gnashing teeth.\r\n\r\nYou never see any of it, not even when you look behind you. You never even seem to notice the hot, wet breaths on the back of you fragile neck.\r\n\r\nThe spiders are afraid for you, because you never hear the terrible thing the creatures whisper in your ear as you sleep.\r\n\r\nYou never hear what they want to do to you.\r\n\r\nIt isn't very nice. Not at all.\r\n\r\nThe spiders silently beg you every night as you stagger out of bed to stop this because they don't know how much longer the things will allow you to pretend you have a single choice in anything, they don't know how much longer you can go on, not with all the terrible things you've done, and the terrible things the pale, misshapen creatures have done it you secret name.\r\n\r\nThe spiders are worried, my friends.","author":"4f41ee04945b701c41002af7"},{"id":"540a8db96368722f45aa0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@gasmaskangel\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/540a8d236368725f2ebe0000#post_540a8d236368725f2ebe0000\r\nUummmm you okay there man?","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"540a8df06368722a7edf0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/540a8db96368722f45aa0100#post_540a8db96368722f45aa0100\r\nHe's probably on drugs.
