We may be heading towards a new sexual revolution.\r\n\r\nTo make a long story short the development of medication to prevent and treat stds are making a lot of headway lately and there's a pill being tested right now that has the potential of preventing HIV from infecting a person.  Basically five years from now we'll have a \"cold, flu and aids\" prevention pill that stops it.\r\n\r\nNo, don't throw away those condoms yet; rather what I mean by this is medicine is just getting better.  HPV is the most common std so get the vaccines.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"540bc41b63687244dd940000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/540bc3de6368727fb38f0000#post_540bc3de6368727fb38f0000\r\nyeeaaaaaaaaah\r\n[spoiler]time for mass orgies[/spoiler]","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"540bc500636872454bb80000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://cdn.nahright.com/news/m.php/2014/02/Common-Be-Frontal.jpg!\r\n!http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51sne9Cls0L._SY300_.jpg!","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"540bc7cd6368723795200100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"TIME WELL SPENT CONSTRUCTIVELY DOING THINGS, FOLKS!","author":"5056c9e87f123b37f6012a34"},{"id":"540bc8b663687232b5aa0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I FUCK THE MUSIC, I MAKE IT CUM","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"540bcc5663687247af670000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"You wake up in the backseat of a car, the first thing you're aware of is burning tightness around your wrists and ankles. You taste cotton cloth in your mouth and your head throbs at the place where the dead man pistol whipped you.\r\n\r\nMoonlight streams through the windows of the car as it bumps down a road, banging and bouncing you around.\r\n\r\nThere is an orange glow from the passenger seat and you smell the skunky sweet scent of marijuana as Deep Purple's \"Highway Star\":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41qfIecwXFg blares tinnily over the car's cheap stereo.\r\n\r\nIt does nothing to muffle the thumping and moaning coming from behind you. It seems you aren't the only unwilling passenger tonight.\r\n\r\nThe car pulls to a stop, and you thrash and moan, desperate to escape, trying your bonds but they're too tight. There is no give to them.\r\n\r\nThe door at your head opens and you look up into the face of...\r\n\r\nȚh͙̳̫̩e̖ ̩͈͝Q̻u̩͎̺͖͈̰ee͓͖̟̟̣ͅṋ̗̠̘̬̯̗͡.̧̻̰̰̮̹̜\r\n\r\nYou scream behind the gag as you look into her eyes. T͏͍̱̻̣̮̟h͍͇͎̗ȩ Q̟͕̫̩̤͎̦̀u̺̞̮͉̠̹ͅe̟̣̬̪̫͜e͝n̙̬̙ smiles at you, exposing a mouth full of sharp, triangular teeth that fit together like the jaws of a trap.\r\n\r\nShe grabs you by the shoulders and yanks you out into the cool desert night.\r\n\r\nHer hands quickly undo your bindings, simply slashing the rope to ribbons. You feel one sharp nail gouge a line across your ankle.\r\n\r\nYou are going to die out here.\r\n\r\nShe forces you to your feet, idly dusting off your shoulders and still smiling that horrible smile of hers. Blood is smeared all around her lips.\r\n\r\nThe dead man strikes something in the trunk with a tire iron and curses.\r\n\r\nThere is a muffled thump and you look to see a man in an expensive suit on the desert ground.\r\n\r\nA shovel follows him, and the dead man tosses it to you.\r\n\r\n\"D̸͈̰͙̩i͠҉̤̫͚̤̳g̷̢̮͞\"\r\n\r\nYou start digging.\r\n\r\nYou can feel the dead man's eyes on you. You can hear wet, meaty sounds behind you, and soon muffled screams.\r\n\r\nThere is so much blood.\r\n\r\nIt carries on until you dug a deep, man sized trench. Sometimes something hot and wet splatters the back of your neck, usually accompanied by a wet crunch and moan of pain.\r\n\r\nYou climb out of the trench and try not to look at the bloody thing and what T̨͔̮͚̯̭͎͢h̴͙̙̟̳͓̦̥̱͙͜͞ȩ̷̶̟͚̻̯͉ ̶͎̰̞̙̗Q͏̨͓̫͓̘̣u̶̼̥͔̗̱̹̳͓͟͞e̙̮e̷͔͓̹̺̪̭͢n̳͉͔͙͙̘ is doing to him.\r\n\r\nIt is soon hurled into the pit, and you hate yourself for being grateful for that. You try to convince yourself that it isn't still moving down there.\r\n\r\n\"Good work,\" the dead man grunts.\r\n\r\nYou turn and look at him. Six feet tall and built with hard, thick laborer's muscle. His face is waxy and pale, his eyes a brownish black ruin.\r\n\r\nThere are six holes in his chest and stomach, the white shirt he wears stained around them.\r\n\r\nHe is holding a gun.\r\n\r\nHe is pointing the gun at you.\r\n\r\n\"Please...\" you say, your voice quivering as you stare down the small revolver's barrel.\r\n\r\n\"We got a debt, you and me,\" the dead man says, \"you have a price to pay.\"\r\n\r\nHe fires six times, and you hit the ground, blood spilling from six holes in your chest.\r\n\r\nT̨͔̮͚̯̭͎͢h̴͙̙̟̳͓̦̥̱͙͜͞ȩ̷̶̟͚̻̯͉ ̶͎̰̞̙̗Q͏̨͓̫͓̘̣u̶̼̥͔̗̱̹̳͓͟͞e̙̮e̷͔͓̹̺̪̭͢n̳͉͔͙͙̘ walks towards you. Her face is drenched in blood and it mats her fine white hair.\r\n\r\nShe bends over you as everything goes cold and dark, you can smell pot and blood on her breath.\r\n\r\nThe last sensation you experience as a living creature is her lips pressed to yours.\r\n\r\nYou wake up, cold and numb on the desert dirt. The other dead man is sitting on the mound of dirt smoking a cigarette.\r\n\r\n\"We got a lot of work to do,\" he says.","author":"4f41ee04945b701c41002af7"},{"id":"540bcfd56368723568800000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@gasmaskangel\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/540bcc5663687247af670000#post_540bcc5663687247af670000\r\n\r\n10/10 descriptions.","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"540bd0516368720c47250100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@twistedmetalero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/540bcfd56368723568800000#post_540bcfd56368723568800000\r\nI'm doing this just to practice improvising weird shit really.","author":"4f41ee04945b701c41002af7"},{"id":"540bd0d263687245d3b70100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@gasmaskangel\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/540bd0516368720c47250100#post_540bd0516368720c47250100\r\n\r\nwell its kinda working cause i dont really know what happened after the first half","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"540bd17963687270d48c0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://38.media.tumblr.com/cbf26fb66b90d331b5d7f4458f08702a/tumblr_mifs7enIlk1qaben4o1_500.gif!\r\n!http://38.media.tumblr.com/7314475cc16ee877d02a119ec2c6be20/tumblr_mifs7enIlk1qaben4o2_500.gif!\r\n!http://33.media.tumblr.com/1ae9c3dd06dc083c4e426a3de170296f/tumblr_mifs7enIlk1qaben4o4_500.gif!\r\n!http://33.media.tumblr.com/859108f7bb40f10ae0de2f08f70ce523/tumblr_mifs7enIlk1qaben4o3_500.gif!\r\n!http://38.media.tumblr.com/7b807589369c40b90d9a68c33a7f9c3c/tumblr_mifs7enIlk1qaben4o5_500.gif!\r\n!http://38.media.tumblr.com/4b369ad39a3439352fbe0dae4390f83f/tumblr_mifs7enIlk1qaben4o6_500.gif!\r\n!http://31.media.tumblr.com/834bce288bf172621ea100505ba60925/tumblr_mifs7enIlk1qaben4o7_500.gif!\r\nI need to Watch Kyoryuger.","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"540bd1d2636872437fb00000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@gasmaskangel\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/540bcc5663687247af670000#post_540bcc5663687247af670000\r\n*\"He fires six times, and you hit the ground, blood spilling from six holes in your chest.\"*\r\n\r\nSo you manage to stay standing upright long enough for him to shoot you six times with a revolver before falling down? 0/10 unrealistic","author":"5007bbdf7f123b112f00023a"},{"id":"540bd2a563687251b2490000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@PaskaNaakka\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/540bd1d2636872437fb00000#post_540bd1d2636872437fb00000\r\nIt's possible but takes a lot of skill.","author":"52f0834d63687261cba90300"},{"id":"540bd37d636872473c810100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Sup nerds!?","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"540bd3d16368720d3e1b0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://i.imgur.com/bpeS1or.png!","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"540bd4896368727f3a5c0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/540bd37d636872473c810100#post_540bd37d636872473c810100\r\nHey!
