The reason why you're seeing less masculine guys isn't cause there's a illuminati group or something but because less masculine guys are becoming culturally \"hot\".  What I mean by this is that let's look at human evolution the last couple thousand years; we've gotten taller and thicker.  Way back in the day thousands of years ago fat women were considered ideal because culturally it was viewed as that woman was well off financially and thus could afford food.  Human women are the only species with a permanently enlarged mammary gland due to how culture has effected our genetics.  As time has gone on the cultural idealism of women being large has gone away but the large breast thing has stayed.  With men the difference is easy to see; men breasts can function.  Why is it irregular for this to happen?  Because women's breasts are permanently enlarged due to culture effecting evolution; men on the other hand this wasn't ideal.\r\n\r\nWhy are men being \"forcibly feminized\" like conspiracy nuts claim?  They're not; rather the hyper muscular idealism is no longer the ideal.  What I mean by this is that the \"ideal\" man is now viewed as a \"husband\" instead of a \"chunk of meat\".  The difference isn't as noticeable in women but still can be seen in how the \"ideal\" woman is no longer a \"chunk of meat\" and no longer women that once you marry is barefoot in the kitchen.\r\n\r\nTl:dr; culture influences genetics and since the \"ideal\" man is no longer the hyper muscular stereotype this is quickly impacting our genetics.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat does this mean in the long run?  Gender lines getting very very blurred in the long run to the point you're going to have to physically yank off someone's pants to tell what sex they are.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53f43fe163687221cf880100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@ParagonCommander\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53f43fa3636872334ca30100#post_53f43fa3636872334ca30100\r\nAbout how homosexuality and bisexuality have been around centuries longer than homophobia.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"53f43fec63687272b9530000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53f43f136368727449450000#post_53f43f136368727449450000\r\nThis is, almost, the answer of every battle lol.\r\nWhy Superman and Goku will fight if they can team up!
