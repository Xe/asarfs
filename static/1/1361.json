You didn't read that? It was probably one of worst articles I have ever read on Video Games. Full of non-facts, exaggerations, and outright lies. It tried to argue that rape means overpowering someone and that when girls lose it promotes rape culture.\r\nIs it any wonder why _Game Journalism_ is under so much scrutiny right now?[/bq]\r\nThe Quinnspiracy shit going on.\r\nThat shit summarized in one paragraph; A person by the name of Zoe Quinn is caught with gaming journalists to receive positive reviews from kotaku and polygon, this raises a shitstorm about journalistic integrity, gaming journalists call *ALL* video gamers \"terrorists\"/\"misogynerds\" and go around claiming that gamers are going extinct and throwing a hissy fit cause they can no longer contribute money to people they are reviewing, SJW start carrying out cyberterrorist attacks stealing people's identities of those that oppose them and then blaming it on those same people, Phil Fish carries out a cyberterrorist attack on the fbi then blames 4chan, Phil Fish leaks his company's information then blames it on 4chan, Anita Sarkeesian claims to have been ran out of her house and turns out she's lying, SJW have massive amounts of influence in the video game journalist industry and start across the board censoring any and all opposition on sites like 4chan, reddit and on numerous other sites begin threatening physical violence against gamers calling them derogatory terms and creating bots to spam people into submission.\r\n\r\nIt's so bad right now that sites like 4chan, tumblr, reddit which have a history of hating each other are uniting together.  We even have fandoms such as even furries joining the opposition with 4chan without anyone bickering about it because the people carrying out the cyberterrorist attacks are trying to destroy anything and everything that can be considered geeky and not just video games.\r\n\r\nTl:dr; SJW have gained control of the video game journalism industry and now that people have found out and gamers are calling for even the smallest level of journalistic integrity out of them they're trying to tear down all of video gaming and attacking countless groups on the internet.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5400b1a0636872714f780100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5400b0626368722c7d3f0200#post_5400b0626368722c7d3f0200\r\nI just want to play my videogames man.","author":"50c204917f123b31440000a5"},{"id":"5400b1d3636872663c9c0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Number1pegasus\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5400b1a0636872714f780100#post_5400b1a0636872714f780100\r\nWe all do.
