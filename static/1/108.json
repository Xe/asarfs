All modern armies have significant engineer corps. Their purpose being to address mobility issues that'd face an army whether it be to construct a bridge or disarm a land-mine. Or to set up defensive parameters to hold a front-line in defensive or offensive maneuvers.\r\n\r\nIf an army comes to a bridge that's been knocked down - especially in this age - they can deploy aquatic vehicles to go across the river with the needed loads to lay down to begin laying down a quick bridge to move the rest of the force behind them across, or the unit or detachment they're following. Upon completion of the crossing, this shit'd be dismantled to prevent hostile use.\r\n\r\nMost likely they'd have air-support ahead of them to scour out enemy positions so they could be routed away, or to remove the OPFOR's positon ahead of them in bombing runs or to repress them. Helicopter doctrine would also deem it a possibility to put ahead a unit or several units across the obstruction to hold down a forward position to distract or divert enemy forces for the rest of the army to make way and engage and relieve the enemy.\r\n\r\nMining, tunneling, bridge demolition, and the entire process of Total War is not a new thing and would be well accounted for in existing doctrine and training. Whether it be management in logistical networks or simply deploying an armored bulldozer.\r\n\r\n!https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/3b/Baileys_Bridge_in_Korea.jpg!\r\n\r\n!https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/341st_company_building_ribbon_bridge.jpg!\r\n\r\nIt may only be for the better part of the afternoon you've deterred a force, but they will conquer it. Ever since Julius Ceasar built a bridge across the Rhine to deliver \"Veni, Vedi, Vici\" armies have been spitting in the face of sabotage efforts, or a lack of infrastructure.","author":"4fe4bf947f123b175b000001"},{"id":"533a47f8636872131ca70100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@AaronMk\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/533a46ff6368722f96d00300#post_533a46ff6368722f96d00300\r\n\r\nNobody mess with the Engineers\r\n!http://www.cgsociety.org/stories/2007_11/team_fortress/engineer02.jpg!","author":"31bee2686368722a0df23600"},{"id":"533a485d6368725f67210000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Gizoid101\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/533a47f8636872131ca70100#post_533a47f8636872131ca70100\r\nCr*p now I have a urge to play this tf2 again and I had just finally put it down.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"533a493f6368721331ed0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Gizoid101\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/533a47f8636872131ca70100#post_533a47f8636872131ca70100\r\n\r\nDispensers and teleporters are credit to team.","author":"4fe4bf947f123b175b000001"},{"id":"533a4a22636872131c590200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"And when you absolutely need to move a tank and no bridge can be built at the moment.\":http://youtu.be/w4q3cK0Fbv8","author":"4fe4bf947f123b175b000001"},{"id":"533a4ab46368720c7b110300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"WTF?!
