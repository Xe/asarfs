How could a could never go to war?  Simple economics; they made the other countries economically dependent on them.\r\n\r\nIt's simple really, want to prevent other countries from declaring war on you?  Make them economically dependent on you through trade, but to where you don't need them so if they start shit then just pull the carpet out from under them and watch as their country burns down economically.  If everyone in the world and the world's economy depends on you then no one will dare start anything with you.\r\n\r\nTake russia for example; they want ukraine bad, but you know why they haven't taken it by force?  Cause they have a stock market and they can not survive economically if their trade partners sanction them.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5351fa8b636872270c900000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@gasmaskangel\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5351f96f63687219096b0000#post_5351f96f63687219096b0000\r\nYou're right on the money.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"5351fa936368722d1a830000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@gasmaskangel\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5351f96f63687219096b0000#post_5351f96f63687219096b0000\r\n\"California lesbian couple 'starved their three children so badly they looked like concentration camp victims and kept one adopted daughter chained to the floor'.[157][158] Why are California lesbians permitted to adopt children?
