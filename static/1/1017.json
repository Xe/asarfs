Most crimes committed are due to selfish reasons and that most criminals are mickey mouse villains.  Contrary to popular belief things like theft and such are far more common than murder.  You're far more likely to get pick pocketed than you are to get shot.  The other thing to keep in mind is that most murders are committed by someone the victim knows and that you're far more likely to get shot by someone you know than you are to get shot by a stranger.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53d9917a636872180d490100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@PaskaNaakka\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53d9913763687252ffbf0000#post_53d9913763687252ffbf0000\r\n\r\nThem dang facists.","author":"500757fd7f123b75a90003b1"},{"id":"53d991bd636872738a8c0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53d98e956368722aa57a0000#post_53d98e956368722aa57a0000\r\nYeah, but Sturgeon's Law still applies.
