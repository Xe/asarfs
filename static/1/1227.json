You don't have a danmaku of renamon and think that she's over rated?!  I'll stab you in the fucking throat while you're asleep and rape your corpse\".  I'm just going to straight up admit it I don't want nothing to do with the furry fandom cause there used to be a lot of racism, heterophobic and sexist hate on the sites early 2000's.  What I mean by this is back in the day your average furry site/con or shit was pretty much, \"You 'breeders'(derogatory term for straight people)/women/minorities are ruining the fandom!  I'll stab you in the fucking throat!  FURRY PRIDE!\"\r\n\r\nI know cons and sites are no longer like this anymore and that con staff and site owners have massively cracked down on this sort of behavior but there is no way in the everliving hell I'm ever going to a con or interacting with furries to any level because of the shit I've seen.  Why?  Cause simply put while I'm talking about the furry fandom here right now I'm talking about the internet and all fandoms actually threatening to kill someone because of their race/sex/sexuality or threatening to kill someone over cartoon characters is massively unacceptable behavior and some times you have to put on your big boy pants, act like a adult and *NOT* threaten to kill someone in their sleep like a psychopath.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53f120c0636872711d400100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@twistedmetalero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53f11e0063687267504c0000#post_53f11e0063687267504c0000\r\nWhich Scott are we talking about?","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53f120d26368722859b80000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53f120c0636872711d400100#post_53f120c0636872711d400100\r\n\r\nthe scott that made the game","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"53f121816368724bb4c00000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53f120826368723d533c0000#post_53f120826368723d533c0000\r\nThat is one of the main problems with the internet, If you give someone an anonymous voice, They will say stupid shit.
