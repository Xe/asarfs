It just scares the piss out of me.\r\n\r\nI used to not get scared by it cause I would just go, \"Oh just having another hallucination\"; that was until I had one of these while in the presence of other people and several of them went, \"Hey did you see that?\"  \"Yeah looks like someone was trying to sneak up on us\" and described the same person.  So yeah you can understand why it now scares the shit out of me.\r\n\r\nI'm okay, I'm calmed down; it's just super unnerving when it happens.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"533fa7096368726493f80000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/533fa6df63687212f7200000#post_533fa6df63687212f7200000\r\n\r\njontron.","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"533fa9876368720729f00000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/533fa7036368726493f40000#post_533fa7036368726493f40000\r\n\r\nThere are things, seripus things that can make those allucinations and flashes, but there are others that are not so serious...
