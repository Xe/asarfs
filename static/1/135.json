What I mean by this is making a lunar colony right now is just dumb.\r\n\r\nWhichever company figures out fusion first will probably be the ones to make a lunar colony for mining helium-3 and presto for the next couple decades they will have the *ENTIRE* energy market cornered.\r\n\r\nIt's probably going to be boeing in the end, cause they've been making some big strides as of late and they're already big enough to afford the investment.\r\n\r\nSo yeah not only does russia's plan not make a lick of fucking sense, but they're probably not even going to be the ones to make a lunar colony anyhow.  They're just calling dibs when they haven't even gotten what they're calling dibs over in the first place.
