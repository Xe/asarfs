Rather for the sake of the argument let's imagine the usa and such culturally as a very large fish bowl with a lot of water to the point that if the tank broke there would go your house insurance; now let's imagine new things introduced to a culture as food dye.  Every time you drop a drop into the water it ever so slightly changes the color to the water overall.  Now imagine continuously dripping anime food dye into the bowl; while a drop every second or so doesn't seem like a lot eventually the color of the fish tank will start changing.  What I mean by this is that is otaku culture eventually going to be saturated into western culture to the point that it has a visible effect?","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53e6f4446368726572040000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"who is up for a game of cards against humanity?","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"53e6f751636872659a650000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I just finished Kamen rider Kuuga.\r\n\r\nIt was Great.","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"53e6fad86368724ea8e60000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I need good novels to read.
