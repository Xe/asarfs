He'll spend a good 2 minutes making fun of people who like Nintendo games and products just because \"OMG Nintendo is for children. I'm go play my game with guns and be mature.\" At least Bennett is intelligent enough to back up his claims. Hell he's humble enough to admit when he's wrong.

When people watch a six minute video game review they want FACTS not humor. And he still makes fun of Nintendo fans. That's WORSE than badmouthing a company.

While tragic the difference between a \"conflict\" and a \"war\" is number of deaths.  The reason why I hesitate to call the Mexican drug war still a war is that the number of deaths has drastically dropped from the ten thousand of 2013 to only a couple hundred.\r\n\r\nThere will always be conflict in the world, but over the last couple of decades the number of deaths in war overall has been drastically reduced.  While conflicts are tragic they are nothing to write home about.  The reason why not to get bent out of shape over conflicts is that it means a war has cooled down enough to the point where you're more likely to die from a car accident or such.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53d7ab696368723241210000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Shadow_the_Hedgehog\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53d7a6bf63687209027a0100#post_53d7a6bf63687209027a0100\r\nAnd here back to our regularly scheduled edginess.
