Also 99% of mods are completely fucking useless other than, \"oh look at the shiny that you can unlock\" so if you just don't bother with most of them you don't have to worry about them.  Shit like ars magicka and thaumcraft and such are pretty much all but useless; mods like applied energestics, openblocks, computercraft are far more useful.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53ff03f663687239aa890100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\r\n\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53feff466368725989cc0100#post_53feff466368725989cc0100\r\n\r\nOkay, wow I never realized that minecraft had that many issues. \r\n\r\nWell the good thing is I'm still just running with my 1.7 version. \r\n\r\nAlso I gotta ask, for that fanfic I was talking about before in which the USA gets invaded by races from WOW. Historically speaking, the US government would take the advantage of going to war again wouldn't it? \r\n\r\nThough to be honest modern weaponry vs fantasy races using steel and iron based tools and armor kind of seems I dunno overkill doesn't it? Or maybe not, since the WOW races would have magic on their side, and shamans and so forth. \r\n\r\nBut then again the US has tanks, jets, warships, ICBMs and a lot of guns. Hmm this is a little complicated for me, I'm torn between making this a story in which the US goes around kicking the crap out of the Horde and then invading the Night Elves homeland for oil, I mean they technically have access to such raw materials, its in the lore and game. \r\n\r\nAnd the other aspect would be more about exploring the world of Azeroth with the USMC, which is still pretty much the same thing as above, the only difference is that its more based on individual stories. Also a lot of cussing and violence, and marines trying to hit on elves... and hot girls. 'All guys would probably do that last part though, wouldn't we?'

I used to play with weapon mods, that was fun for like the first half of the game and it became a pain in the ass since I had to keep looking for the right materials to make the ammo and guns. Also vehicle mods were fun, but I haven't used them since last year. \r\n\r\nHave you tried any of these other mods? Just for fun kind of stuff you know.

I mean have you seen the realistic water designs they have? Those are so freaking awesome, having them mixed in though would probably destroy the performance of a computer though.\r\n\r\nBut yeah Tekkit is also part of this packaged deal isn't it? I mean I like Tekkit cause there's a ton of stuff you can build and do with Tekkit, but making it run with a lot of other mods, I dunno, how compatible are all the mods right now?
