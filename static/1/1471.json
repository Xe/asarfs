In order to start back up a club you have to have several members already.

So what I have been trying to do is get people I definitely know are glbt to help sign. . . Well today I found someone that's ftm, but I tried metaphorically reaching out to them and asked them and they got offended.  I know a lot of people come from shit families, but it just feels weird at someone else that is trans to get offended at someone being accepting of them.
