It takes knowledge and skill. Ever watch a pro fisherman? They catch fish within minutes because they know where to fish, what lure to use, and what time to fish.\r\n\r\nOne of the best techniques out there is the dying minnow trick; you get a lure that looks like a minnow or even use a real one if you can and basically jerk it through the water very erratically but not too hard. This looks like an injured/dying fish and fish will go after it even if they are not hungry. This is because it's an easy meal that can't swim away.","author":"5010fa077f123b1e4f00104e"},{"id":"5342337563687210ae2b0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@gasmaskangel\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/534233366368724a7ab00200#post_534233366368724a7ab00200\r\nSmartass.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"5342338d6368725c96e10000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SeraphimDawn\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/534232dd6368720a701f0000#post_534232dd6368720a701f0000\r\n\r\nExcept you're going somewhere you know will come at more-or-less the same time after you started and there's more ass holes.
