With all the advances in synthetic biology and other fields I have to revise what I think the future will hold.  Basically imagine fifty years from now androids you could have biological kids with and be your and their's kid 100% and them being pregnant and the full ten yards too.  That's not a joke either.\r\n\r\nHow?  Well basically in order for us to understand how the human brain and body and mind works we're having to learn how cells, neurons and such work on the cellular level first and are reverse engineering it.\r\n10-15 years: we'll have cybernetics.\r\n15-25 years: prototype AIs using chips that mimic the human brain and prototype synthetic biology organs and such(not synthetic cells, but rather synthetically printed things such as synthetic muscles[we're getting so far into blurring the lines of biology and machines that I don't know the terminology for it])\r\n20-30 years: synthetic humans that are for all intents and purposes are human that only until you drew blood and test their dna will it show up that they don't have dna\r\n25-35 years: dude; we're going to be so far down the rabbit hole biologically that we're going to run out of things to make science fiction about.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe thing that technological advancements don't follow Moore's law. If you ever hear someone say, \"technology doubles every two years\" that's completely mis-quoting moore's law.  Moore's law is that every two years that the number of transistors we can fit on a chip is doubled until we get to single atom transistors.  This is often misquoted for how fast we're advancing technologically; transistors have nothing to do with technological advancements.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"540e54b16368724a5eb80000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/540e503d6368725b0bbe0000#post_540e503d6368725b0bbe0000\r\nD-Does that mean in the future I could be!\r\n!http://cdn.superbwallpapers.com/wallpapers/games/jetstream-sam-metal-gear-rising-revengeance-17236-1920x1200.jpg!\r\nJETSTREAM SAM!?

The people that go \"we'll never have cyborgs, androids and such\" are like the people that go, \"making a car with no tools or materials needed is easy so why can't you do it?\".  Right now we know what components we need to make a car, but we don't know how they work together or how to put them together properly.  We know all the individual parts of the car, but we're still working on learning how to put them together.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso:\r\nIt's especially fucking annoying explaining to naysayers why we can't program human level AI yet in that we're working on the actual programming language right now so asking us for metaphorical windows xp out of the box when we're still making the programming language is fucking ridiculous.  To use another analogy it's like someone saying they want a AAA 100 hour video game with next gen graphics done in only one week.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"540e5909636872764ead0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Side note: for some odd reason when I make a science related post the thread always seems to get quiet; why is that?","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"540e59426368723721b00100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/540e5909636872764ead0100#post_540e5909636872764ead0100\r\n\r\nim working on my music so i really cant concentrate on much else.\r\n\r\nalso im pretty sure even if read i dont got anything to reply that can add.","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"}]}
