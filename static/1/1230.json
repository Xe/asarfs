When you put them together how society currently works simply couldn't survive in such a system and large portions of how things are done now will simply collapse in on themselves.\r\n\r\nCybernetics cause you know I love this shit:  aesthetic prosthetics and other parts are only actually a couple years away; it's going to be a couple decades until you can replace all your organs because internal organs are harder to do.  Anyways robo-penises and robo-vaginas means no more stds which means another sexual revolution.\r\nAlso cheap prosthetic \"plastic\" surgery means completely flip turning our current idea of beauty on it's head and massively changing culture.  Want to be a 7' hot Brazilian woman with G breasts?  Want to be a ripped dude that looks like he could give superman a run for his money?  Want to be a nekomimi?  Want to be a furry?  Want to be a pokemon?  Imagine prosthetic \"plastic\" surgery will do to culture.\r\n\r\nI'm going to summarize the economic impacts but basically with the advancement of robots we're looking at a exponential decrease in number of work hours you have to do because of exponentially lower costs of production.  What I mean by this is thirty years from now sure you may only work less than five hours a week but at the same token cost of food will be much lower as well.\r\nThe problem with this is simply put our current economic systems aren't meant to handle such a transition.  When we economically transition we'll be fine but chances are a lot of capitalists, communists and socialists are not going to be happy.\r\n\r\nThe other reason why a lot of people are going to be pissed off is because we already have computers that handle the stock market in ten/twenty years from now the stock market floor will be a bunch of computers instead.  Do you think a lot of bankers are going to be happy?\r\n\r\nWe're also talking about a complete collapse of the prison industrial complex.  One of these ways I'm talking about is how self driving cars coming ~2 to ~3 years from now.  Do yo think cops whose duty it is to patrol highways to prevent drunk drivers will be happy about this?\r\n\r\nWe're also talking about a massive shutdown of the health sector in that to use a analogy surgeon bots are actually being developed.\r\n\r\nAnother example is the war industry; since the collapse of the soviet union the number of wars has drastically dropped and by proxy deaths due to war.  The only exemption to this is the middle east.  The armed forces in the usa is already preparing for this inevitability because simply put many countries will probably in the next decade or so axe a large portion of their military budget because the chances of another cold war/world war as time goes on is exponentially decreasing because if no one but the middle east will be at war then what justification will there be to have a large military if they're not involved at all in the middle east?  Right now there's ten wars going on and half of them are calming the fuck down.  In ten years what justification will there be to have a large military if there are theoretically only five wars in the world.  Sure countries involved in the middle east will have justification for their large budgets but countries that don't have anything to do with the middle east won't be able to justify their budgets.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53f1514a63687255f4420000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53f150e36368725188280000#post_53f150e36368725188280000\r\n>Pokemon\r\n\r\n...Go on.","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"53f151be6368721524c80000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53f150e36368725188280000#post_53f150e36368725188280000\r\nso essentially\r\neverything is going to be great\r\nand that will fuck everything over\r\n\r\nkind of","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"53f152c96368723a90e00000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53f151be6368721524c80000#post_53f151be6368721524c80000\r\nPretty much.\r\n\r\nA lot of small towns rely on car tickets for income for certain necessities; with self driving cars how will they get that money needed?","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53f1538a63687239610a0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"hmm\r\n\r\nall i can think is that without a massive military budget, which as far as i know is in the billions, at we'll have a surplus of money to actually aiding people and fixing issues like that\r\n\r\ni assume\r\ni don't actually consider myself well versed in things\r\n\r\nand then we'll get the people who assume that the moment we drop the budget the entire world will attempt to nuke them, so we need to keep the military around forever or die","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"}]}
