Its enjoyable as a dumb popcorn movie, but I'd kill to see it done better, preferably with a hard R.\r\n\r\nIt helps that I'm not terribly enamored of the comics. Don't get me wrong, I like Alan Moore's work. V for Vendetta is one of my all time favorite comics, From Hell is brilliant and Watchmen is a goddamn masterpiece but something about the comic version of League just rubs me the wrong way, I think its that aside from Quartermain I'm a big fan of a lot of the other stuff he uses the characters from and don't particularly appreciate his takes on them.","author":"4f41ee04945b701c41002af7"},{"id":"535602ec63687204778b0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@gasmaskangel\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/535602476368726fb7ec0000#post_535602476368726fb7ec0000\r\nThe man has admitted that characters he doesn't like don't get treated well.\r\n*cough cough* Harry Potter *cough*\r\n\r\nThat might be a reason.","author":"500757fd7f123b75a90003b1"},{"id":"5356038263687265f0b70100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Princess♠Molestia\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/535602ec63687204778b0000#post_535602ec63687204778b0000\r\nAhhh Harry Potter.
