Hold on I don't mean that as a generic, \"God is good blah blah blah\" way. I mean that as a thanks to religion the code of hammurabi was created and that religion has played a big role in society.  While I am against theocracy, I do recognize the importance it plays in society.\r\n\r\nGoing back to what I realized; out of all the religions past and present in the world I realized something.  While a lot of religions depict their god/s/esses as caring divine individuals there's one religion that one of their gods sticks out above the rest.  Prometheus.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow don't get me wrong people are allowed to believe whatever they want, but Prometheus was pecked by a bird of his own mythos for giving fire to man.\r\n\r\nPrometheus defied his fellow gods and went, \"fuck that\" and actually committed this to help others.  That is why in my book religion wise Prometheus to me mythology wise is the most benevolent.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"52e33a91636872633bc50200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/52e32ec46368723d1c850000#post_52e32ec46368723d1c850000\r\nThe fear of god(s) may had a major role in this, while not worshiping Zeus could imply consequence according to the priests because of his power, Prometheus could have been saw as a god who didn't mind that much not receiving many tributes.\r\n\r\nAlso as others divinities hated Prometheus, seeking his blessing may had been seen as dangerous for causing their wrath and an act of defiance against the pantheon.","author":"509129db7f123b36cb010fa5"},{"id":"52e457ec63687210e0950000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"Mai's mom is a stone cold bitch.\":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_0yodnegYU","author":"5041b54f7f123b77af00a442"},{"id":"52e4583963687210e0aa0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I'm Depressed now,\r\n\r\nJustin Carmichael of You can play this!
