She was a total asshole who never wanted to take responsibilty for her own actions. And this may be selfish of me but when your job is the protection of the world you don't get to sit in a corner and worry about \"What if he doesn't love me.\" Seriously what does ANYONE see in Mako? He's soooooooooo fucking boring.
