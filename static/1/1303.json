If anything having a all female cast is a good thing because it's not pandering to otaku; rather it's giving us heroes and characters that are positive role models for women.\r\n\r\n\r\nReimu(the shrine maiden) even though her job is to exterminate Youkai such as the vampires and such and even though she's a foul mouth hot head she is still a good person that refuses to kill anyone no matter who they are and is quick to forgive people for their wrong doings befriending them in the process.  Even though she claims she hates vampires, fairies and such hanging out at her shrine and \"being a nuisance\" during one of the manga she admits that it's not so bad being friends with them.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53fac2a16368723dbd750100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53fac2126368727712b90100#post_53fac2126368727712b90100\r\nWhich, coincidentally, was what Lauren Faust wanted MLP to be.\r\n\r\nMan, it be so cool if those two meet up in real life.","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"53fac2d2636872766e1e0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SeraphimDawn\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53fac2a16368723dbd750100#post_53fac2a16368723dbd750100\r\nAnd then made a game!","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"53fac35c6368726a2b5b0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53fac2d2636872766e1e0000#post_53fac2d2636872766e1e0000\r\n!http://images6.fanpop.com/image/photos/36100000/Rarity-the-Unicorn-image-rarity-the-unicorn-36167238-895-892.png!\r\nFabulous.","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"53fac38e63687277dcd20100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SeraphimDawn\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53fac2a16368723dbd750100#post_53fac2a16368723dbd750100\r\nJust think one singular video game franchise gave video gamers over a hundred positive female characters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm up to episode 9 of Kamen Rider Fourze; I'm not sure what time my internet is getting shut off tonight, but I'll try and watch as many episodes as I can.
