Cause men are talk to suck it up.  I don't care what anybody says; if someone goes around hitting their spouse with a chair and bashing their face into the kitchen sink that's abuse; just cause your spouse has their reproductive organs on the outside doesn't mean it's not abuse.\r\n\r\nWhy do men get raped more?  Easy; lots of prison rape.  If you're ever in prison for the love of god don't drop the soap.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5419147e63687205486f0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"4kids apparently dubbed Ultraman tiga.","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"541914f76368723500230000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5419147e63687205486f0000#post_5419147e63687205486f0000\r\nLOL What?","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"5419169a6368723fdd840100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"For if you ever hear anyone saying 'the usa is going downhill' or other crap\":http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv12.pdf\r\nIt covers pretty much everything.\r\n\r\nBiggest thing about it though; homicide rates since 1993 are 48% down.
