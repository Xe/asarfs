It can be really nice to see a comic or novel adapted word for word as a movie but some things don't translate well. Like the watchmen movie (which I personally loved) had scenes that were basically live action versions of the comic panels and most of the dialogue was exactly from the comic. But alan moore's writing... I don't know, it can be sort of overdramatic when actually spoken out loud. \r\n\r\nAnd then you have the situations like you mentioned before with frollo where they make an element from the original story much more interesting. Another good example is the beowulf movie. Again, very flawed but I liked it. It makes  beowulf as a pathological liar. They expand on the stories behind grendel, grendel's mother, the king that preceded beowulf and the dragon and it basically paints the original story as being from the perspective of beowulf's companion who believes every word he says without a doubt.
