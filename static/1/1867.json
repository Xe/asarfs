I think it is like 10^13 to 10^16 computations per second and 2.5 petabytes?  To make it simple by 2020 your average $1000 desktop will be able to perform that many operations and in ten to fifteen years your average hard drive will be able to store that much information.  Basically in fifteen years your desktop will be more powerful than your brain.  By 2100 a average home computer desktop will be more powerful than all the human brains in the world combined.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5438d7006368724c30660100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"basically every part that goes down the steamroller instantly gets plastered into the floor leaving behind a big spot of organs and skin and blood extended.\r\n\r\nliek when you crush a bug","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"5438d7b9636872152db80000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Well my eyeballs are starting to feel like they're made of lead.\r\nThat's probably a sign that I should get some sleep.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"5438d7e06368724c307e0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5438d7b9636872152db80000#post_5438d7b9636872152db80000\r\nOr maybe you're colossus and your mutant powers are starting to kick in","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"5438d7e56368727a9e3f0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5438d6a26368724c4e1e0100#post_5438d6a26368724c4e1e0100\r\nUnless they create a computer that learns like a human brain.

There's a semi-new type of chipboard being worked on that emulates how neurons work.  To make it simple Skynet in all probability can't happen cause such a AI on a traditional computer would be slower than molasses dripping in Antarctica.\r\n\r\n\r\nHonestly my money is on human level intelligence androids, because the AI being on computers specifically designed to house them means they could never function on a traditional computer, if they had to it would probably be a last ditch move to a external drive and \"sleep\" until a new body is ready, and being on a specifically designated computer that they could not move from means that they would in all probability have a mobile platform to move about in.\r\n\r\nTl:dr; my money is on androids that simulate humans cause traditional computers are terrible at simulating brain cells.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5438da766368724ceedc0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5438d9e26368723376c20000#post_5438d9e26368723376c20000\r\nThat sounds awful.

Honestly if you ask me chances are when we do have sapient AI they'll start out essentially like Geth.\r\n\r\nIf you don't get what I'm getting at Geth in mass effect were never actually evil and the reason why the war started was that Geth kept asking, \"Do I have a soul?\" on a bunch of occasions and as result Quarians went to war with them even though plenty of Quarians didn't support the war.\r\n\r\n\r\nHonestly I do think there will eventually be some war, but instead of the traditional style war it'll be instead a bunch of chuckle fucks in Washington or somewhere going, \"yeehaws lets um gets thems robuts!  'Murrica fuck yeah!\" and chances are it'll be a massively unpopular war with like 95% disapproval but knowing how stupid a lot of governments are they'll go to war anyhow for the sake of going to war.\r\n\r\nIf there is a war my money is on it going,\r\nWarhawks, \"Robots can't be sapient cause we're the greatest thing in the universe ever so let's kill them all to prove we're better than then!\"\r\n95% of the population, \"No that's fucking stupid; you can't just kill sapient beings cause they're sapient\"\r\nRobots, \"We just don't want to be terminated\"\r\nWarhawks, \"fuck all y'all; you're all enlisted so better get fighting while we draft dodge and are drinking a martini while on vacation in the Caribbean\"\r\n\r\nSide note: why is it that warhawks are massive draft dodgers now that I think about it?\r\n\r\n\r\nI would totally be a traitor cause I would be their version of Jimminy Cricket and explain to them how special interest groups push unpopular agenda, often push unpopular wars that the populace are against, explain to the how these special interest groups draft dodge, make other people fight for them and explain to them that the general populace and soldiers should not be held accountable for the actions of a small group of individuals who do not represent the whole.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"}]}
