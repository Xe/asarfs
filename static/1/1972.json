And then escapes off into the Everfree Forest. As for the stuff after that, its going to vary. \r\n\r\nI'm looking into three possible kind of story lines to follow, either it has the pilot siding with the ponies cooperatively, then again it'll follow much like Article 2 on FIMfiction, maybe not as much, but sort of like that story. \r\n\r\nOr its more like the human character interacting with Equestria in a more secluded fashion. Around Ponyville probably, and have him doing things between Everfree and so forth. \r\n\r\nOr just have it as a comedy kind of story with lots of fillers and so forth, randomness is boundless.
