As you all know, I am a massive Vocaloid fanboy. There is just something about them that connects with me, and with that knowledge I'd like to welcome you all to the first ever Derpibooru version of Miku Monday. If you're curious as to what Miku Monday is, allow me to enilghten you. Each Monday your gracious and glorious SquiggyBomb will post three different Miku songs as well as a short bio as to what the song is about and/or what the song means to me as an individual. So let's get this started!\r\n\r\n\"Love is War\":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1Dqb6uJ8WY\r\nLet's start this off by going back in time a bit. Love is War was the first ever Miku song to grace my virgin ears. This song holds a very special place in my heart as not only the first song I heard from Miku but the first Miku song I ever learned to sing. Love is War is about the incessant urge for the center of your affections to actually acknowledge your affections. That's right. The entire song is an extended \"I hope senpai notices me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rolling Girl\":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMDxKRx10mU\r\nA song that has no defined meaning but can be interpreted many ways. Although if I must confess it's the piano that always brings me back and not just Miku herself. Something about that opening tune never fails to get my heart racing and my foot tapping.\r\n\r\n\"World is Mine\":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdXgoIjS7UM\r\nAnd we finish with another of the most famous Miku songs. World is Mine really illustrates the versatility of Miku's character and identity to me. How she can be a soul tormented by self-loathing or a materialistic bitch and it never feel out of place or character. Although the core of World is Mine is about how even the most materialistic people on the planet can still have a heart. It also helps that it's catchier than herpes.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54450dd56368726e87ae0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!https://31.media.tumblr.com/020dc6e9cdc616501689d5b3418fefd5/tumblr_inline_ndkb8yfnXe1rzfuj2.png!","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"54451618636872019d850400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"DandyÂ´s bizarre adventures\r\n\r\n!http://i.imgur.com/iMSMekt.png!","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"5445225f6368723f31520000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@twistedmetalero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54451618636872019d850400#post_54451618636872019d850400\r\n*LOL*!!
