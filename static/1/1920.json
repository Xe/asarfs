I'm not gonna put a spoiler over this because no one cares any more. Naruto and Sasuke continue their fight and Sasuke continues to be stupid and emo. That's pretty much all that happens.\r\n\r\nBleach:[spoiler]Verge on Vermillion. Oetsu, the swordsmith of the Zero Division is surprisingly badass. He proceeds to cut down all of Juhabach's elite guard one-by-one. Then he makes some strangely sexual comments about the sharpness and flexibilty of his sword. Saying that it's too sharp. After he cuts down Askin Nakk Le Varr he then goes for Juhabach himself. Only to be stopped by Askin who is  not actually dead, standing up and making a cryptic comment about his powers.[/spoiler]\r\n\r\nOne Piece: [spoiler]White Monster! So Law is a D. and we are getting more information about what that really means. Apparently anyone who is born a D. is \"God's Natural Enemy.\" And it is  revealed that Corazon is a Devil Fruit user as well as a Marine informant. Corazon then kidnaps Law to get Law's White Lead poisoning cured. Unfortunately most hospitals aren't  having that shit and refuse to treat Law. Corazon gets, rather understandably, PISSED. Good chapter this week.[/spoiler]\r\n\r\nToriko: [spoiler]Endlessly Surrounded! So abunch of monkeys  gang up on Toriko  and the group and they proceed to fight them. And then the islands infrastructure is explained. Apparently  the monkey island functions on a Hierarchy where strength is the key. And they all practice weird monkey martial arts. After the Big Boss of the island appears he knocks Torkio and the group underground to the ruins of an ancient city. Then what appears to be a Nitro shows up and offers to be their guide.[/spoiler]\r\n\r\nShokugeki no Soma: [spoiler]Iron Will, Heart of Steel! Hayama and Kurokiba begin their match. The theme  is a western style dish. Hayama is using duck where as Kurokiba is using eel. It's also explained that while Kurokiba may look complacent and lazy, during a competition he is nothing short of ruthless and violent.[/spoiler]","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"544183476368725b8b3c0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/544182466368720b73de0200#post_544182466368720b73de0200\r\nAs a kid myself I can tell you, but it'll cost you.
