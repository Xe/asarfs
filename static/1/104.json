We have the bestest graphics! Buy now!\", but once we hit the upper limit of what the human eye can see that's it for the hype.  After that there for everyday use will for the most part no longer be any reason to drop thousands of dollars on new computers.\r\n\r\nAfter that happens computers as we currently know it will probably change.  The reason being is that the current hype is towards better performance and video games is one of those things, but after we reach the point where better performing computers has no real effect on most of our daily life the industry will probably move towards making them cheaper and smaller.\r\n\r\nBasically what I mean by that is I'm going to buy a computer in a year then wait another five years for a new computer, because in five years time your average computer will probably just be a small thing the size of ipod that you hook your monitor, keyboard, mouse and so forth into instead of a actual tower or so forth.  We already have computers like that; hell there's handheld sized computers that can play modern computers; they're just super expensive though.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53386fe363687273105c0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@QuasarNova\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53386f0163687272d12e0000#post_53386f0163687272d12e0000\r\n\r\nI know that.
