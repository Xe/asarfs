It is much more convincing to make others agreeing with you using actions, without saying a single word.\r\n\r\nHere's what I mean. The main issue when trying to probe an argument or achieving a victory through a discussion is that in the end, you can't be certain how that will affect the one's you're arguing with; it may seem they politely agree with you, but on the inside they might resent it. Or maybe, when you say something that offends them; words just have the particularity of being interpreted according to the mood and insecurities of others. Not even the best argument has a solid base, because in the end, we all end up doubting of their elusive nature. And days later after reaching an agreement with someone, more times than none, we will always go back to our original opinion due to force of habit.","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"535834ad6368721a55d20200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"So maybe I've been spending too much time on Tumblr lately - which will probably invalidate what I'm about to say - but there's something I'm confused about, and have been confused about for a pretty long time. People are accusing Katy Perry of being a racist because she wore a kimono on stage once and hung out with Kyary Pamyu Pamyu who, by the way, claimed to be a fan of her work. I'm failing to see the problem of wearing a kimono here.\r\n\r\nI mean, from what I understand of their cultural origin, kimonos aren't the same as something like, say, a chief's warbonnet, in the idea that nobody had to go through bloody battles and other terrors for those feathers. It's cultural wear. What's wrong with wearing it; are people afraid that it's not going to receive the \"proper\" respect? Am I overlooking something?","author":"5041b54f7f123b77af00a442"},{"id":"5358350d636872461ebb0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@And Brother I Hurt People\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/535834ad6368721a55d20200#post_535834ad6368721a55d20200\r\nAt least tumblr is being somewhat consistent by hating on Katy 'Gurlpower' Perry for it.\r\n\r\n","author":"4fe16df67f123b13e400003f"},{"id":"535835b76368722607720100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Whatevs\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5358350d636872461ebb0000#post_5358350d636872461ebb0000\r\n\r\nFrom what I've seen of her - which isn't a lot, mind you - Katy Perry seems to be a decent person. _shrug_","author":"5041b54f7f123b77af00a442"},{"id":"535835da636872461e100100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@And Brother I Hurt People\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/535835b76368722607720100#post_535835b76368722607720100\r\nI don't know of anything she's done wrong either.\r\nTumblr is gonna tumblr","author":"4fe16df67f123b13e400003f"},{"id":"5358363b63687235f3680100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@QuasarNova\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5357537f63687214123d0000#post_5357537f63687214123d0000\r\nThat sounds alright to me.
