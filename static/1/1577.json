Moral conscience has its roots in humanity, not in any one book or the words we put around.\r\n\r\nFor instance, arguably the greatest moral philosophy in the Bible and certainly one of the more quotable lines of Jesus \"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you\" can be found with little variation across numerous faiths all over the world.\r\n\r\nAnd frankly I don't believe that even most decent Christians derive their morals from the Bible, however I will continue that train of thought in the Religion General thread.","author":"4f41ee04945b701c41002af7"},{"id":"541662796368722d56dc0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@gasmaskangel\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/541661dc6368725ee9650100#post_541661dc6368725ee9650100\r\neven if christianity was the source of these morals\r\nthey are such common agreed upon things now, that removing religion now, shouldn't remove these morals\r\nunless certain do only follow those morals for religious reasons\r\n[spoiler]i no speak good[/spoiler]","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"541662bd636872337fdb0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-mg6iBm8SYnY/T4jyPcjPLfI/AAAAAAAAB0I/RDDbmGNXNWc/s1600/mucore+swing.jpg!","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"541663316368723d1b390000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@gasmaskangel\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/541661dc6368725ee9650100#post_541661dc6368725ee9650100\r\nYeah, I guess.\r\nA lot of Confucian moral philosophies are eeriely similar to Abrahamic philosophies.\r\n\r\nLaws didn't just simply come out of nowhere. Humans, to a degree, naturally have some sense of moral restraints when being around others of their own kind. Religions and customs that often influence civil laws are only certain people's interpretations of morality.","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"541664016368723861660000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"removing religion wont affect humanity is my opinion.\r\n\r\npeople dont need a book to know what is moral and what isnt.\r\n\r\nand people who do bad things are just using the bible as a scapegoat, they would do bad things regardless.\r\n\r\n\r\nbut placebo effect can be a powerfull thing, and it can drive a manÂ´s will against all odds and make him succeed if he believes there is something beyond.\r\n\r\nso at the end religion is a natural thing to be born, just like language, its bound to happen no matter what we do.","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"541672106368727005a50000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@twistedmetalero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/541664016368723861660000#post_541664016368723861660000\r\nA wise man once said, \"If God did not exist, we humans will make one.\"\r\n\r\nI'm pretty sure I misquote that, but it's something close.","author":"4fe1b9f47f123b13df002976"},{"id":"541673ae6368722a373b0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@HJSDGCE\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/541672106368727005a50000#post_541672106368727005a50000\r\n\"If God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him\"- Voltaire.","author":"4f41ee04945b701c41002af7"},{"id":"541673c06368721f394a0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Is this turning into a religion thread?\r\n\r\n\"Religion Thread is here\":https://derpibooru.org/dis/religion-general/post/541672df636872702bd30000","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"541673ff63687228c08c0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"this is tumblr levels of retard.\r\n\r\nkanye west noticed someone wasnt standing in the concert, so he told him to stand up, and told everyone to say stand up.\r\n\r\nkanye then noticed the guy was in a wheelchair and said\r\n\r\n\"he is in a wheelchair?
