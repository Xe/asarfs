The type of warrior she is a knight.  So basically imagine Saber from fate/stay as a vampire but instead of defending her partner part of the story is about them working together as equals.  Also she's regal and while she's from the middle ages she doesn't go around going, \"doth/thou\" or such, but her battle style is more along the lines of a knight in modern era.\r\n\r\nThat doesn't sound anything like Twilight does it?","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53d9b8b9636872229f4c0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"If it was on their own, I think that Riderman should fight Batman.","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"53d9b8ec636872215ba70100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53d9b8a76368720f3d5e0100#post_53d9b8a76368720f3d5e0100\r\nI think you're safe.","author":"4f41ee04945b701c41002af7"},{"id":"53d9b9136368727707bd0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Ore-O\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53d9b7606368721daeb30000#post_53d9b7606368721daeb30000\r\n[bq=\"Ore-O\"]\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53d9b366636872219e1c0000#post_53d9b366636872219e1c0000\r\nWell, so what do we do now?[/bq]\r\nShut down fucking everything in those countries, cause the stage of the outbreak is in the-\r\n!http://nighthacks.com/roller/jag/resource/ShitHitsFanMediumT.png!\r\nstage.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53d9b9a86368727e99c80000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53d9b8a76368720f3d5e0100#post_53d9b8a76368720f3d5e0100\r\n\r\nI'd say that's pretty unTwilight","author":"500757fd7f123b75a90003b1"},{"id":"53d9ba426368724b9e370000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53d9b9136368727707bd0000#post_53d9b9136368727707bd0000\r\nLooks like we hit Pandemic!Madagascar stage.","author":"513e68eda4c72d4e3b000164"},{"id":"53d9ba836368727e99ff0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Does anyone have any idea what could be Good Opponent/s to the Legendary seven based on my descriptions?
