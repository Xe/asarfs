Now hold on I don't mean the traditional kind, nor do I mean intellectually stupid; rather I mean they don't have a fucking clue what \"consumer friendly\" means.\r\n\r\nWhat I mean by this is that the latest version of playonlinux(a program to play games on linux obviously) totally broke everything, but rather than fix the problem with it the reaction by the community is \"oh it's super easy to fix.  All you have to do is install this one IDE, use it to fix this one patch then use this other program to apply the patch.  It's super easy cause all you need is to know two different programming languages; I'm sure even children can figure it out cause of how easy learning programming languages are\".\r\n\r\nHere's a quick tip to any programmers: if your average person needs to know a programming language to even be able to use your product and/or needs more than ten minutes to fix a bug you fucking failed at making a successful product.\r\n\r\nI honestly can't wait until steamos comes out cause it's going to be hilarious watching generic linuxfanboys(yeah I know I talk about how great it is, but I still recognize the problems with it and agree it's total bullshit) justify to millions of consumers why they feel as though average consumers need to know programming to use their \"consumer friendly\" products.  I'm going to laugh my ass off when that happens cause there's going to be a massive shitstorm between linuxfanboys and people that actually have a brain cause it's literally going to be \"these non-programmers are ruining linux with their demands of having a operating system that doesn't require programming language to know how to use\".\r\n\r\nNow before someone thinks I'm biased I think all the operating systems are shitty in their own way; linux is shitty cause it's not consumer friendly and the people writing programs for linux don't understand that your average consumer doesn't have a background in programming.  Macs are shitty cause of their costs.  Windows is shitty cause microsoft will never make a stable operating system and is more interested in \"ooh pretty\" than actually making a good operating system.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"543b09386368726422ae0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"ok, solid orange, hand pattern.\r\n\r\nstill no material, which is important, cause without a material then the rest of the custom items wont work.\r\n\r\n","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"543b09a8636872542fa60200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@twistedmetalero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/543b09386368726422ae0200#post_543b09386368726422ae0200\r\nWhat about that weird Metal looking material?
