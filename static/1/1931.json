I used to have numerous things to the point you couldn't psychically touch me without me having a complete breakdown(if you hugged me back then I would have smashed your face into a desk and began beating the shit out of you while crying and laughing) and over the past five years I've reach the point where I no longer have the vast majority of them *without any medication or any psychiatric help until three months ago*.  I'm actually doing fairly well actually; the main things I'm taking care of is me being transgender is interfering with my schoolwork, but I've started working on transitioning because if I weren't to start I would psychologically stop working; the other thing is I wouldn't call it necessarily depression so much as massive emotional and physical dissociation.  Basically even though I seem normal and express normally I don't actually \"feel\" much emotions at all.\r\n\r\nTo use a analogy I'm like Hata no Kokoro; I can express emotions, but I don't \"feel\" them a lot and I don't \"feel\" a lot of things.  To use a extreme analogy I can technically feel pain but I'm dissociated with it in that if I were caught off guard and injured it would just confuse me more than anything else.  It's probably why I seem like such a strong person both physically and mentally because if I'm doing physical work I can work until my body gives out cause I don't \"feel\" the tiredness and why I seem strong to people mentally cause I don't \"feel\" the sadness or such.  Oh sure emotional situations do effect me still, but they effect my ability to function rather than me actually feeling depressed or sad.  I do have emotions; just not nearly to the level everyone else has.\r\n\r\nTl:dr; UC9 in a nutshell:\r\n!http://i.ytimg.com/vi/lIM1mCzCLCY/maxresdefault.jpg!\r\nTl:dr that don't get the analogy; I'm good at acting as though I'm emotional, but I'm not good at actually being emotional.\r\n\r\nSide note: god help you if you ever play poker against me.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54422cb763687271d9fe0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54422bb063687275cc4c0000#post_54422bb063687275cc4c0000\r\n\r\nnext game night game confirmed: poker.","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"54422e3e6368722b297f0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54422bb063687275cc4c0000#post_54422bb063687275cc4c0000\r\nI'm trying to think of a touhou analogy for me but I'm drawing a blank.\r\nFlirty, boisterous, and loyal with a deep connection to my family despite all the shit I've gone through.
