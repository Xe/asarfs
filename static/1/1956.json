I know I thought of Akuma's cave from Street Fighter Alpha 3 as his background. With Fortinbras as the final boss, his background is based off the settings of the final battle for Onimusha: Dawn of Dreams, completely with the Omen Star hovering in the background.","author":"5056c9e87f123b37f6012a34"},{"id":"5445a63a6368727a8bc50100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Bryon\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5445a56763687219a50f0000#post_5445a56763687219a50f0000\r\n\r\nYou plan on having support like the other Jump characters?","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"5445a6ff63687231d8ae0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@QuasarNova\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5445a63a6368727a8bc50100#post_5445a63a6368727a8bc50100\r\n\r\nNot sure. I know I thought of having various Jump and Capcom characters appear in the backgrounds as well as in endings and the like.
