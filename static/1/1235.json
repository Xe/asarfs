I own this thing called a IPL; basically a hair removal laser.  It's highly suggested whenever using it to shave beforehand and not use it on hair that has grown, if the hair is grown to shave it, if you have grown hair there to shave it and especially don't do so on maximum intensity. . . Well I ignored all of these warnings and did my eyebrows.  I kind of melted the hair follicles in the hair sheath(the area in which your hair comes out of). . .
