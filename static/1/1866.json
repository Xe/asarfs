I will admit that it's just my opinion though. Lovecraft like to speak of human's feebleness and fragility but I can't support that kind of mentality.

Beings far superior to us in every way that seek knowledge about us just as much as we may seek knowledge about them. \r\nThey're kind of dicks about the whole mind displacement though. \r\n\r\nAlso there's a page in the story that's just a list of more badass sounding names that the protagonist talked to while his mind was displaced. \"Nug-soth, a magician of the dark conquerors of 16,000 A.D\" for example. \r\nThat's all I know about him from the story but you know some shit went down in his lifetime.
