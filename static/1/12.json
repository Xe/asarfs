I'll fill these lines with cobblestone to serve as a foundation, then dig out the internal area and lay down whatever blocktype I want to be my floor. That's how I prepare the area for construction and setting up construction.\r\n\r\nUsually I'll end up destroying any and all forests around me on my quest for wood and other basic resources. But I tend to keep the saplings to replant to keep a sustainable wood supply, or for decoration.","author":"4fe4bf947f123b175b000001"},{"id":"52dd5e7e6368724ac8910100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@And Brother I Hurt People\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/52dd5ccc63687272fcd60000#post_52dd5ccc63687272fcd60000\r\nFlat land make it easy, though spoil the scenery that a realistic terrain can give.

Well I always sort of blindly built whatever I wanted after I laid down the foundations and floor. Except for maybe the barn I'm building on EQP's server.\r\n\r\n\r\nI guess what you could do then, in lack of any idea, is to look at pictures of palace's or fancy estates to figure out what you want to do, or make it look like. From there, it's just knowing what blocks to use to get the right look. Also properly lighting the damn thing.","author":"4fe4bf947f123b175b000001"},{"id":"52dd605563687209e5890300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"You could always watch some video tutorials on Youtube.
