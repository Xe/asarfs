I haven't played outlast yet, but the problem with amnesia is that the monsters have very predictable AI so after a while it gets boring.  Slender is only as scary as long as you don't know the locations of where the pages are; it would be a million times more scary if the locations were extremely random; right there's only 10 possible locations for pages which drastically reduces the fun of it once you've memorized where they are.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53f6a38763687222b94e0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53f6a3226368720fee6f0000#post_53f6a3226368720fee6f0000\r\n\r\ni was talking about the slender arrival game, but i havent played it so meh\r\n\r\n","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"53f6a49e6368726123f20000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"twisty made another shitty thread\":https://www.derpibooru.org/dis/the-asmr-thread\r\n\r\nthat guy has no life.","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"53f6a4e4636872600ef20100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@twistedmetalero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53f6a38763687222b94e0000#post_53f6a38763687222b94e0000\r\nArrival's only really challenging parts are exactly the same as the original game. The rest of the game is a walking simulator. An extremely atmospheric walking simulator with great faux camera effects but still lacking on gameplay.

To use a analogy remember when twobestfriends played slender; the reason why one of them wasn't scared with the first game was because he didn't know the lore; the second game he was scared cause he watched marblehornets.\r\n\r\nThe reason why people are getting so excited about FNAF is that you don't need to know anything about the game, the AI are unpredictable(where amnesia fails is that the AI is very predictable) and that when foxy comes out the entire gameplay mechanics gets flipped on it's head.\r\n\r\nPersonally I think FNAF is going to be remembered for at least a couple years because of the replay value in that there is no definitive way of winning.  Amnesia you just need to know how the monsters act to win; slender you just need to know the page locations to win.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of marblehornets and slender did you know there's a slender movie being worked on?","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"}]}
