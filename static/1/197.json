Oooooooh fuck.  I realized what may be the next depression in the global economy.  I know I sound like a broken record talking about upcoming new technologies, like how there's going to be a 2016 cybernetics olympics or how by 2024 a $1000 computer will run as many computations a second as the human brain(basically a desktop as powerful as the human brain), and constantly talk about new and interesting things(if I'm boring you just tell me to stop), but here's something big that is a big downside.  In ten years time there's a big chance that 80% of the minimum wage workforce filled with minimum wage workers will become obsolete and replaced with robots.  I don't mean every single job, but rather 80% of them out the door.\r\n\r\nWhat I mean by this is if you are a minimum wage worker then you better damn find a better field cause there's a massive chance you're going to get replaced in the next decade.  Cashier?  Nuh-uh, that's going to go out the door.  Burger flipper?  Nuh-uh, that's going out the door.  Janitor?  Nuh-uh, that's going out the door.\r\n\r\nWhy?  Cause let's say you only work 40 hours a week minimum wage and the store is open 24/7; the store is going to need on average 4 people for each position to keep it open 24/7.  What I mean by that to fill a janitor position 24/7 they're going to need several people to work days, evenings, nights and weekends.  That's 60k a year just to hire enough people to fill the janitor position so the store doesn't turn into a garbage dump.  Here's where the problem starts; why pay 60k a year for janitorial duty when you can buy a 20k robot to do the same job?\r\n\r\nSo that's 80% of people that work minimum wage or close to minimum wage. . . yeah. . that's a lot of people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you work close to minimum wage, you better find a new job and fast, cause there's a overwhelming chance you may be out of job.  As someone that's having to go back to college for another degree cause my old field is becoming obsolete you better not think this can happen to you or you'll wind up in my current situation having to go find a new industry to work at.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"535f06da63687278c41b0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/535f04c463687249821f0000#post_535f04c463687249821f0000\r\nMachines replacing jobs is nothing new.

They're working on fixing the final programming bugs wise to make sure it won't crash in accident avoidance scenraios and they're going to be cheaper than you think.\r\n\r\nThe old system relied on lidar cameras, which was very expensive, the new system scrapped that and now works on traditional cameras instead which cut tens out thousands of dollars off the sticker price.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"535f1ac46368724d8b900000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/535f07e06368720dd5420000#post_535f07e06368720dd5420000\r\nThe previous systems which I believe are still being worked on and which have already proven to work just fine, are based off of GPS. A car drove all the way across CA with no incidents. If we can have autopilot systems that can do the entire job of a pilot including takeoff, climb, cruise, descend and land plus the more advanced things like avoid bad weather and change flight plans all on their own and we have had this technology for years (it was used on the Concorde) then I see no reason now why we can't have cars that drive themselves, we already have cars that can parallel park themselves although they don't work all that well because they use cheap (read:crappy) technology to do so.","author":"5010fa077f123b1e4f00104e"},{"id":"535f1d736368720591e90000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@someguy111\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/535f1ac46368724d8b900000#post_535f1ac46368724d8b900000\r\nI mean the camera system for object detection while driving.  GPS is used to for planning the route yes, but you still need cameras on the cars to detect oncoming objects; you can't just have solely a gps system expecting it to not hit things.\r\n\r\nWe have the technology for self driving cars, for self piloting planes, for self steering boats; the reason why it's not here yet is they're making sure it's safe before booting it out the door.  Do you really want a car that will drive for you that hasn't been real world tested yet?  It's not cause of some conspiracy to stop it or such, rather they know the second there's a accident involving it they're going to get sued; so better to make sure it's as close to accident proof as possible so you don't get sued to death.\r\n\r\nSure we have the technology, but it would be like putting a car on market off the bat without testing to see if it's airbags, seatbelts or brakes. . okay brakes are a bad example, but you see the point.  If a product as a whole is unsafe and countless people are getting injured cause you never tested it then yeah you're going to get sued.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"}]}
