Akuma sees himself as having trascend humanity, even if he tossed it away when he gained the power of the Satsui no Hado, and Raoh seeks to be the Conqueror at the Century's End.\r\n\r\nWith Firebrand and Neuro, both are demons, who have antagonistic natures, yet both have been seen as heroes. Firebrand has his outward appearance and Neuro looks more human, plus both are crafty, tricky devils :)","author":"5056c9e87f123b37f6012a34"},{"id":"54432b3d6368724fdff30000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"hey i didint noticed the updated the comment section.\r\n\r\nnow i can see what creepy avatar the waifufags have alongside their creepy comments-","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"54432c9d63687204c1360000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Bryon\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54432aaa63687254cbbe0000#post_54432aaa63687254cbbe0000\r\nYou should add a character from Eyeshield 21!","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54432ca76368721b6a0c0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@twistedmetalero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54432b3d6368724fdff30000#post_54432b3d6368724fdff30000\r\n\r\nAnd a lot of people is complaining for the change.\r\nFirst was because the space in blank was to big, second was that the comment shows the amount of post in forums, then the avatars because are very distracting.\r\n\r\nI really don't care about change, in fact, I like it a bit.","author":"5239db6da4c72d22d9000358"},{"id":"54432f4a6368725944680100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Shadow_the_Hedgehog\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54432ca76368721b6a0c0000#post_54432ca76368721b6a0c0000\r\n\r\ndistracting from what? we are in a site about colorful horses having sex, or just coloful horses if you are a weirdo.","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"544330fb6368727beae20000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@twistedmetalero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54432f4a6368725944680100#post_54432f4a6368725944680100\r\nHuman nature man, people always bitch and moan about any sort of changes, even it they are for the better.","author":"4f41ee04945b701c41002af7"},{"id":"544331486368727bcfd80000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@gasmaskangel\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/544330fb6368727beae20000#post_544330fb6368727beae20000\r\nAnd now I get to confuse even more people with my frequent icon changes!\r\nHurrah!","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"544331526368724fdfad0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54432c9d63687204c1360000#post_54432c9d63687204c1360000\r\nIf I do, I'd go with Sena since he's the main character. :) I know I wanted to go with a little more unorthodox characters from both parties, like how Capcom has done before with Tatsunoko vs. Capcom as well as Marvel vs. Capcom 2, 3, and Ultimate 3.","author":"5056c9e87f123b37f6012a34"},{"id":"544331dc6368726a3d000100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Bryon\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/544331526368724fdfad0100#post_544331526368724fdfad0100\r\nSpecial move.
