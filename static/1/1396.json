Why?  Cause even if the fucked up mythological shit in the world was true can you really say that they would be more evil considering the shit that has happened in the past?  I'm not shitting on anyone's religions or such, but if you have to justify your morality as \"<x> looks different and/or disagrees with me therefore it's evil\" I'm going to have to disagree with them.  A lot of mythology and such is incredibly fucked up across the board.

Individuals should be judged on their individual actions.  To use a personal analogy I have a massive biological disposition towards being ultra violent and have a massive biological disposition towards being hyper-emotional and unable to control my emotions, but that doesn't determine who I am as a person and I have never once hit someone not in self defense and a pacifist.  Why have I never hit someone not in self defense and a pacifist?  Cause my biological disposition does not determine what I do with my life.  For all of when I was in middle school and high school numerous people constantly nicknamed me \"tick-time bomb\" and yet I never hit someone not in self defense and I have only once ever unintentionally hurt someone.  Why?  Cause biological disposition shouldn't determine who you are.  I have a massive disposition towards extreme violence and to be completely honest I hit like a fucking dumptruck, but you will never ever see me hit someone; sure I'll grab your wrist, twist it behind your back, knee you in the back and place you in a hold that if you try to break out of you'll break your arm doing so, but you'll never see me hit someone.  Why?  Cause my personal beliefs of non-violence supersede my biological disposition.\r\n\r\nTo say that a individual should be judged by their biology is to say that sapience and independent thought does not exist.\r\n\r\nIt is easier for people to just write everything off as biological dispositions causing individuals to do things than it is to realize that causes for actions are more complex.  It's easier to paint all of <x> as \"evil\" than it is to realize the cause of something is complex.  Again I'm not shitting on anyone's religions but it's easier to have stories about \"the evil villain is evil because they're evil\" than it is to have stories about complex morals with complex reasons for actions being taken.\r\n\r\nTl:dr; it's easier to think of everything in terms of \"the evil villain is evil cause they're evil\" than it is to recognize sapience leads to complex thought.\r\n\r\nTl:dr; of Tl:dr; sapience fucks up black and white morality.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5403b8fb63687228c6de0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5403b67863687262baf40100#post_5403b67863687262baf40100\r\nExactly.\r\n\r\nI personally am inclined to distrust anyone who tries to use our piddling understanding of the whole of genetics (we are, realistically speaking, still woefully ignorant) as a basis for judging people.\r\n\r\nWhat's more using \"human\" as a metric for how someone ought to be treated is an incredibly dangerous position because who gets to define what \"human\" even means? There would have to be a legal definition made, and invariably that would result in people getting hurt and oppressed for not quite being human enough (by being poor, or the wrong race, or deformed and so on.)","author":"4f41ee04945b701c41002af7"},{"id":"5403b9d563687223bc820100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I'm always lost whenever this thread goes into philosophical talk.\r\n\r\nThe only Godzilla monsters I can see posing a problem for Seven (Besides the man himself) are Destoroyah, King Ghidorah, And The most powerful versions of mechagodzilla.","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"5403ba196368722406990100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5403b9d563687223bc820100#post_5403b9d563687223bc820100\r\n\r\nmy philosophy doesnt go further from \"dont be an asshole to people who arent being assholes\" so there is not much discussion i can put.","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"5403ba7a63687209d9cc0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5403b9d563687223bc820100#post_5403b9d563687223bc820100\r\nThose all seem like reasonable match ups to me.","author":"4f41ee04945b701c41002af7"},{"id":"5403bb486368720a30340100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5403b9d563687223bc820100#post_5403b9d563687223bc820100\r\nTl:dr; don't be a asshole, the bar for assholery doesn't change just cause of who you're born as nor does who you are excuse asshole behavior.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5403bc086368727b14490000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5403bb486368720a30340100#post_5403bb486368720a30340100\r\nOkay.\r\n\r\n\"@gasmaskangel\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5403ba7a63687209d9cc0000#post_5403ba7a63687209d9cc0000\r\nIf what I've heard is true, Destoroyah killed Godzilla, And While Seven may be a durable son of a bitch, I doubt that he's *That* Durable.
