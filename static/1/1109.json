What I mean by this is that the reason why sex sells in mass media when you get down to it is because western culture at least vilifies sex in mass media while at the same time putting it on a platform for all to see.  What I mean by this is that mass media tries to be both people's metaphorical rehab doctor and their drug dealer at the same time.  Sex only sells because it's vilified by the same people.\r\n\r\nTo put it simply the best way to deal with sexism in mass media isn't to champion against the \"evils\" of sex, but rather for people to no longer think of it as evil and instead just another aspect of life.  The reason why you see so many movies and such that market to the lowest common denominator is because sex is so vilified.  People are championing against sexism in mass media all wrong; the best way of stopping sexism in mass media would be for western culture to accept sexuality as a part of life.  To use a analogy it'd be like if a parent of a kid used a belt on them for watching porn but at the same time let them buy sports illustrated swimsuit posters.\r\n\r\nIf sex and sexuality were to be thought of just another aspect of life if a company were to market towards trying to sexualize something people would instead just go, \"yeah, okay whatever\" because it would be considered normal.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53e449a16368723441a80000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53e448ff636872070f460100#post_53e448ff636872070f460100\r\nPretty much.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"53e449cc6368727631c80000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@gasmaskangel\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53e447bc63687261102e0100#post_53e447bc63687261102e0100\r\nMe:\r\n\"Saver of humens\"\r\n!http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/592/760/70a.png!","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53e449cd63687279a75c0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53e44871636872798e460100#post_53e44871636872798e460100\r\nand yet you talk about the same things as them.\r\nThey have a Spiderman thread, you speak of spiderman.... there's some kind of scheme going on\r\n!http://i.imgur.com/DBUwn2B.jpg!","author":"4fe16df67f123b13e400003f"},{"id":"53e44a236368721436b70100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53e448ff636872070f460100#post_53e448ff636872070f460100\r\nWestern culture has long since deteriorated. \r\nThe anti-sexualization aspect is just a remnant that crops up in opposition","author":"4fe16df67f123b13e400003f"},{"id":"53e44b496368724b50b70000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53e448ff636872070f460100#post_53e448ff636872070f460100\r\nHave you ever noticed that the people who do try to sell stuff based on sexing it up always do so in the most vanilla possible way?
