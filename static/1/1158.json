They're fixing that with the sequel and making the gameplay actually baller.\r\n\r\nFor those of you that are going \"what is monster girl quest?\" I'll summarize it in a nutshell; obvious spoilers [spoiler]You follow Luka; the dumb naive protagonist who doesn't understand that the basis of wars in the world isn't simple black and white as he goes out to defeat the monster lord only to realize the girl he's been denying that he had a crush on is the monster lord.  As you go on with your protagonist that refuses to kill anyone he constantly gets his thick skull neck deep into wars and conflicts between morally gray factions with no real villain for the first two parts.  He solves these conflicts using his thick ass skull metaphorically as a battering ram to ram through these conflicts often times winding up with no winners.  Often times the conflict isn't fully resolved and the groups grudgingly admit defeat with negative feelings towards the opposing group still lasting.[/spoiler]\r\n\r\nBasically imagine if you gave a dumb idealist that doesn't understand the wars and such he's getting involved in can't be solved through wishful thinking the fighting ability to win against the opposing groups.\r\n\r\nIf you can look past the fact that it's visual novel game it's a pretty damn good story.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53e86c88636872304ea00100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53e86c1a63687275bf2f0100#post_53e86c1a63687275bf2f0100\r\nYou're forgetting [spoiler]all the femdom, reverse rape, straight shota, monster girl porn.[/spoiler]","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"53e86e3a6368727b584b0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53e86c88636872304ea00100#post_53e86c88636872304ea00100\r\nSounds like the best part","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"53e88411636872445a550000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Ah, sexy Disney fanart that is not Elsa\r\n!http://38.media.tumblr.com/2ccdf920b93ab5c8e0a38727df82128d/tumblr_na1x0mfFCT1riqrywo1_1280.jpg!\r\n\r\nNow that I've got your attention, am I allowed to request for a 3-month ban?
