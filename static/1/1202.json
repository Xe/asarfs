What I mean by this is that the last couple of decades in the usa the reaction by police has been, \"Protest without a permit?! EVERYONE DOWN ON THE GROUND!  Everyone is under arrest!  Use the teargas!  Shut everything down!\" which in this case was drastically making things worse.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53ee293e636872052c210000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"When DA was still relevantly new but an established \"art\" site, my parents yelled at me for using it because they thought it was a porn art website (because of the name, I suppose?).\r\n\r\nI guess they weren't entirely wrong.","author":"5041b54f7f123b77af00a442"},{"id":"53ee29ec6368720fa6930200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@And Brother I Hurt People\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53ee293e636872052c210000#post_53ee293e636872052c210000\r\nI always wondered why they called it \"Deviant\" Art.\r\n\r\nCuz it really does kind of sound like you're gonna be signing up for some porn site if you have _never_ heard of it before. \r\n\r\nPretty funny really.
