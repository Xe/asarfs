about aliens for a second, but I think I realized why we haven't found any yet.  The reason being is that if we find any they'll probably either be microbes in our solar system/earthlike planets that we'll never know if they have life or not cause if they do have life they'll be underdeveloped technologically and will never receive any transmission from them/or so far advanced that we won't be able to comprehend them.  The only chance we'll ever find anything that isn't a microbe would be a world that has had a industrial revolution and has gotten to the point technologically where they are putting out radio waves, *BUT* the thing is that when you think about it the further along technologically the less and less likely we'll realize they're there.  What I mean by this is they'll eventually stop being something we can physically interact with and become more like the aliens from 2001 space odyssey.\r\n\r\nThe aliens in that movie were so far advanced that their consciousness were stored in the monoliths.\r\n\r\nTo use our world as a example; eventually we're going to have ai technology and so forth and as time goes on biologically born humans will not be able to compete in any facet against people that have undergone becoming more and more machine than flesh.\r\n\r\nThe most realistic scenario for what will eventually happen to us here on earth is that we'll reach the point in which we continuously add on more and more machinery and more and more machinery to our brains that eventually we'll stop being flesh and blood all together.  At that point it's a question of technological advancement.\r\n\r\nSo in other words finding a alien civilization that has a technological level of in the ballpark of around 1850-2200 is astronomically small.  If we do find any they'll either be so far behind us technologically that we won't be able to communicate with them or they'll be so far ahead of us that we don't be able to understand them.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53521f2d63687250a79b0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I'd like to learn how to use a shotgun or a rifle someday.","author":"50b70eeb7f123b1a02000097"},{"id":"535227a4636872779b0e0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53521f1763687250a7890200#post_53521f1763687250a7890200\r\nThey probably have the same problem.","author":"4fe1b9f47f123b13df002976"},{"id":"53522ab86368727ff71e0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@HJSDGCE\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/535227a4636872779b0e0100#post_535227a4636872779b0e0100\r\nProbably.\r\n\r\nThe chances of finding a alien race in the same ballpark technological advancement levels in the correct time we would receive their transmission is so astronomically low that we would have to listen in on every solar system in the galaxy.\r\n\r\nOther than that they're either not advanced, not evolved to be sapient or so far advanced that we simply don't understand them.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm not going to lie; if I live long enough that we reach the technological singularity and the human race becomes a type 1, 2 or 3 civilization I'm probably going to be a galatic criminal and illegally tamper with evolution on underdeveloped planets.\r\n\"Hm kepler 581d only has basic protozoa. .
