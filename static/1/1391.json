Like Finland.\r\nYeah, it will suck for Russia (the poor are already malnourished there, and the sanctions aren't gonna make it any better for them) but shit is going to fly in both directions, no doubt about that.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut in the meantime, i get to play 'spot the paid kremlin trolls'; a game where you look through the comment sections of news sites and spot the pro-russia trolls. Yes, they have paid trolls posting propaganda there, and they are exactly as obvious as you think.","author":"5007bbdf7f123b112f00023a"},{"id":"54028fa06368720404800000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@twistedmetalero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54028e4f6368725bef880000#post_54028e4f6368725bef880000\r\nXD","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"540290176368721ddb7c0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@PaskaNaakka\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54028e9463687207d03b0100#post_54028e9463687207d03b0100\r\nI know I'll be hated for this.

The reason why shit was so bad in world war 1 was that you had a bunch of countries with no real top dog all making treaties with each other and then one day the house of cards fell down.\r\n\r\nI really hate the concept and I hate war, *BUT* they do have a point that there has to be a top dog or everyone starts breaking out into a angry mob where everyone is punching each other for no real reason.  I'll be the first to admit I hate war, but would you rather Russia be the political power house of the world?
