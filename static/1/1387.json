Lately I've been feeling kind of weirded out that the vast majority of my favorites here, especially my first year and a half or so of favorites, is overwhelmingly comprised of NSFW artwork. It IS the reason I'm here on an alternate alias instead of under my usual name, but it does make me fear I give off the aura of being here, or in the fandom in general, only for the nsfw.\r\n\r\nThat's far from the case, though; I enjoy mountains upon mountains of safe artwork in the other places on the 'net I frequent, and consider myself an active and productive member of the fandom. It just so happens that this is the only place I can collect and catalouge the NSFW and highly suggestive art I like, in more-or-less private, since the 'explicit' tag is hidden by default for others that may stumble upon it lol. After sorting through 'normal' work on dA and tumblr and whatever, I show up here to, among many other things, browse the explicit tag. XD Also the YLYL thread, Flitter and Cloudchaser tags, 'adorable' tag, 4chan and /mlp/ tag, Shyabetes, et cetera, and stalk specific artists' work. I'm just still quite averse to associating myself publicly with NSFW artwork of ponies from a little girl's cartoon... \r\n\r\nI have met awesome people here though. Met one in person even, hung out for a while at Bronycon two years running. It's an excellent place to find a ton of excellent art in a user-friendly manner, so I guess I'll stick around and explore ALL the images! woooo\r\n\r\nAnd for discussion purposes, *it is finally raining!* Just a little bit so far, but fingers crossed more is on the way. _Is it dry where YOU are??_","author":"4fe165a87f123b2f98000e82"},{"id":"54024f256368723434770000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Squall_Line\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54024d836368725109d00000#post_54024d836368725109d00000\r\n[bq=\"Squall_Line\"]And for discussion purposes, *it is finally raining!* Just a little bit so far, but fingers crossed more is on the way. _Is it dry where YOU are??_[/bq]\r\n!http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_7YJDpzkOkaA/R4T8w5ZcSGI/AAAAAAAAAAc/Rs0xI3lkgs8/S660/20070818RT0158.jpg!","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54024f9d6368727d75380100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Squall_Line\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54024d836368725109d00000#post_54024d836368725109d00000\r\nYou know, I used to freak out when I see Pokemon or other porn myself. Thankfully, series like Touhou, and the realization that these are just fictional characters helped me adapt to these environments. Ironically, it's also part of growing up to learn that these things exist and everyone has their own take towards things like this. I'm telling you, I used to be disgusted by porn myself, and thought that only rapists enjoy porn.","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"540250b963687252e98d0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Everyone probably already knows my stance on porn.\r\n\r\nThe *ONLY* character I refuse to look at porn of is Byakuren cause I like her character too much and it just feels really weird to look at porn of her.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5402531a636872786f470200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54024f256368723434770000#post_54024f256368723434770000\r\nPFFHAH!
