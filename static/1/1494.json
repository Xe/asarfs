None of that was a exaggeration or fabrication in the slightest.\r\nIGF, a massively important organization in gaming, was caught racketeering.\r\nRumors are Phil Fish, creator of Fez, has ran from the country after IGF was found out to be racketeering.\r\nAnti-gamergate crowd are so desperate at this point to be validated that they're creating a universal blocking bot for their side to block everyone with a dissenting opinion.\r\nReddit was caught red handed saying that they will accuse admins of distributing child porn if they support the anti-SJW side.\r\nNeogf caught red handed censoring and banning anyone with a dissenting opinion.\r\nKotaku banning anyone that disagrees with them.\r\nEscapist forced to change their code of conduct.\r\nGamasutra journalist had a massive breakdown that was taken down and was hilariously sad.\r\nKotaku added a clause disallowing racketeering to their code of conduct.\r\nSJW caught red handed stealing people's bank information, social security numbers and fabricating evidence.\r\nAnita Sarkeesian distributed child porn to her 100k followers by redistributing a tweet aimed at her instead of reporting it to the fbi; gamergate side were the ones who reported it to the fbi and got it taken down.\r\nSJW attack and take down a pro-womens charity.\r\n\r\nTl:dr; video game journalism massively corrupt.  SJW, third wave feminists and anti-gamergate side are massively desperate for a win cause they picked a group of people to bully that they can't win against so they're resorting to doxing, stealing people's personal information, blanket internet censorship, cyberterrorism(no not a joke either) to win cause \"lost the fight\" is not something they can physically understand.\r\n\r\n\"If you want a longer explanation that explains the full story\":http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/826/711/3b4.png","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"540dff1c63687239de050100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Number1pegasus\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/540dfdc16368726b99ca0000#post_540dfdc16368726b99ca0000\r\n\r\nDepends. \r\n\r\nManga...
