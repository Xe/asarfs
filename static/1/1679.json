The anime made by Urobutcher. \r\nSeriously that anime just finished its first season just recently and I have to say that it was one hell of a shocker. The main character dies thanks to some white haired idiot who thought that saving the life of a manipulative murderer bent on bringing total destruction to humanity was a good idea. \r\n\r\nAlso he ended up indirectly getting the love of his life killed. So yeah double whammy, well at least the manipulative jackass is dead. And we've still got a missing princess, who may or may not be dead. \r\n\r\nMan I'd love to see if anyone can turn this into a good MLP fanfic. \r\nThough someone would have to figure out how to kill off 4 characters off around the middle of the story.
