One Democrat in Kansas is getting pushed by the entire Democrat party to drop out cause of his low popularity; if he drops out Democrats will maintain control.  Republicans haven't learned their lesson and are possibly going to do another government shutdown in September; this may reverse the election in Democrats favor.  Even if Republicans gain control of the senate it won't matter much because we're talking about them gaining control by literally only one person.  Republicans plan on after next election resorting to government shutdowns on a regular basis to get things they want such as repeal of the ACA.  The reason why they're freaking out so bad is that their long term electibility doesn't look too good in that they're going to lose 2016, 2018, 2020, 2022, 2024 so yeah not looking good.  The reason why is because they have screwed up with the younger voters because of how they still refuse to support gay rights and shit.  At this rate social conservatism is probably going to die; the Republican party that will remain will no longer be tea party or social conservatives but in all probability economic libertarians in that they're last major group that Republicans can strike accordion with voters still.  Tl:dr; ding dong social conservatism is dead.\r\nIn other news did you know if you replace random words in sentences with musical instruments your brain will ignore it?","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53fd88ff63687214de770200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://i.4cdn.org/b/1409115640363.jpg!","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"53fd958a63687272c4810200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Decide to not be useless\r\nDo laundry\r\nPut laundry on bed to fold\r\nGet distracted\r\nDog vomits what appears to be an entire, unchewed veggie omelette on to the clean clothes","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"53fd96c6636872649eb60000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Update on the dude killed in Ferguson:\r\nA new audio recording has come up.

Anything in particular you're looking for? If its theme parks we've got Universal Studios, Disney Land, Knott's Berry Farm, Six Flags and some other parks I'm probably forgetting.\r\n\r\nIn the LA area there are also some really excellent museums, The Museum of Natural History, The LA Fine Art Museum (conveniently located right next to the La Brea tar pits museum), The Getty Center (another fine art museum, The LA Science Museum, and probably way more that I'm forgetting. There is also Amoeba Records, a kick ass music store.\r\n\r\nOutside of LA you can head south to San Diego, where there is an excellent zoo and a dry docked aircraft carrier you can get a tour of, and heading north... well when you get to about palm springs or so not only will you have been smacked in the face with all sorts of natural beauty, but you'll find The Living Desert, a sort of combination zoo and botanical garden, speaking of which there is also the Hunington Library, which is a combination of Fine Art Museum and botanical garden.\r\n\r\nAgain, I'm probably leaving out a lot.","author":"4f41ee04945b701c41002af7"},{"id":"53fdf317636872502f220000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I have nothing to really say.","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"53fdfbe36368720e82790000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@QuasarNova\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53fddf206368721272d20000#post_53fddf206368721272d20000\r\n\r\nnevermind all that, this was rewritten by somebody else, who honestly did a shitty job at it, but im sure some repeated words were there before.\r\n\r\n[spoiler]i was just talking about proper puctiation and redundancy[/spoiler]","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"53fe00ba6368723b3f830100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@gasmaskangel\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53fddfbf6368726471550100#post_53fddfbf6368726471550100\r\n\r\nOkay cool, I hope to see a lot around the country, though one state alone seems like quite a lot.
