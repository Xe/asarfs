Europeans/Canadians/New Zealanders/etc do you want some popcorn as well?

But I don't feel my beliefs are threatened by this \"gay marriage\" thing.\r\nBut then again, some may believe that the real danger in this becoming _too mainstream_, is that those who are genuinely heteros may have a tougher time finding a partner. Imagine what it will be like if someone had to look for a partner, but find out that everyone decent is gay or lesbian.

The reason when you get down to it that glbt seem uncommon is because of bisexual erasure meant to skew results in favor of making us seem uncommon.  Hell for the longest time bisexuality wasn't recognized as existing at all and it was viewed as you either \"had\" to be straight or gay and no in-between.  Even in a most extreme scenario we're only talking about 1/10 people being bi and 1/40 being gay.\r\n\r\nI know it's not exactly credible, but that's my feelings on it cause just now mainstream culture is starting to realize bisexuals exist.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"543199d36368724e10a70000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Honestly\r\nIm think most people can be bisexual\r\nThey just generally end up only finding one side attractive\r\nIm kinda talking bullshit here im sure","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"54319a4363687204ba820000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"i need love","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"54319b49636872509c250100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@twistedmetalero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54319a4363687204ba820000#post_54319a4363687204ba820000\r\nI love you\r\n*hug*","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"54319b7e6368723e75da0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/543199d36368724e10a70000#post_543199d36368724e10a70000\r\nThat's fairly true actually; bisexuality and in fact sexuality isn't a binary, rather it's a gradient.
