Lazy writing or the fact that they wanted to make Spidey anonymous again? \r\n\r\nI'd have liked it if Peter just went and lost it, just became a vengeful guy, or better yet, more darker. I mean have him make that wish and realize that his wife had been pregnant and then lose his child.

Jesus they could have done that so much better. \r\n\r\nI mean he could have had it a bit worse, push him around emotionally and then end up annulling the marriage or have MJ nearly killed and suffer amnesia, or end up in a coma.
