And also can you backstab your neighbor and have someone else replace them? Cause if it does most of that and more, then I think it has some merit in the real world.

What I mean by this is that even if someone \"deserves\" to die I would still do my best to help them regardless.  I still wish them well.\r\n\r\nSure the ebola outbreak if it reaches the middle east could solve the ISIS situation, but it would kill numerous innocent people that had nothing to do with it and were just unlucky to be at the wrong place at the wrong time.  The tens of thousands of people that very well could become infected in the next couple of months for the vast majority don't deserve to die and yet they will die anyhow not cause they did anything wrong.  That's just how the world works in that countless people that did nothing wrong die and merely die because they were in the wrong place at the wrong time, but that doesn't mean you stop caring.\r\n\r\nHonestly I have seen people die; I think the most brutal death I've seen was someone literally splattered all over the place, the second most brutal as a car crash, but that didn't stop me from caring about people to be honest.  If anything it made me realize that you should care about others.  It's easy to clam up and go \"fuck you got mine\" but it's much harder to continue to care about people even when you can't do anything to help them.  Often times there are sick people dying that you can't do anything about and often times it's someone personal, but it's much harder to continue to care when you see them slowly die in the most horribly painful ways imaginable and knowing you can't do anything to help them.  It doesn't get any easier watching people die no matter how much a person clams up and no matter how many you see people die, but it's much harder to continue to care.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI'll see everyone Tuesday cause I need to get some sleep and chances are by the time I wake up the internet will be off.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53fb1c71636872783b260100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Have you guys heard of a movie called Dear Zachary?","author":null},{"id":"53fb582c6368726ca8c60100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53faf4f26368727139d20000#post_53faf4f26368727139d20000\r\n\r\nD'awwwwwww","author":"5056c9e87f123b37f6012a34"},{"id":"53fb591863687217ca7f0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"eminem is making another album.","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"53fb5a6b6368720a89450100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://38.media.tumblr.com/ca516d8f27dab970fa517d2a2e13330f/tumblr_nao2p7asUq1rckw3lo1_1280.png!","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"53fb5e9c63687242a2360100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Straight Fries or Krinkle Cuts?","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"}]}
