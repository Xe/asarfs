The amount is limited, but they can become stronger, over time. \r\nMost average mages can summon basic elemental attacks, and a few more complicated ones, but they all take time to summon, and that can get them killed, they can also only do spells one at a time, so no multitasking. \r\n\r\nThey have a few edges, being able to bring about magically summoned blizzards and such, but it can be haphazard to their allies as well, since a blizzard can effect everyone in proximity. \r\n\r\n\r\nI figured as much, since I've written quite a few stories, I just get side tracked though and lose interest, and kind of kills my great writing skills.
