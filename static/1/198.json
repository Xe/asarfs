Product R&D is a big deal but again the thing is we already have have technology that can do this, the thing is it's still very expensive and when they try to lower the expsnse they also lower the quality. It's basically engineers vs. accountants and businessmen to try to find the compromise between something that works and being as cheap as possible.\r\n\r\nAs an aside, I'm probably shooting myself in the foot for bring up this topic since it's something I'm quite sensitive to but I would really love to see robots replace soldiers. Think about it, if we could make a fully automatic robot that could more or less think like a human, we could make it as strong as we need it to be. No harsh training, no need for food or water, it could go with no sleep, could withstand extreme heat or cold, would not need to breathe so it could sit underwater if needed and would be immune to any kind of toxic gas, could be extremely fast, have incredible long range sight and hearing, could carry as many things as needed, and would be powered by something like solar or nuclear power for a basically infinite power supply. The robots would also be programmed to be as non-lethal as possible, preferring to destroy enemy equipment and weapons and thus make them unable to fight rather than hurt or kill them. That way people on either side would suffer no human casualties. If a robot gets blown up, who cares? It's metal and oil, we can just build another one, humans are irreplaceable. I realize I could be oversimplifying things but just think of the basic concept for a minute and think how much this could improve things.\r\n\r\nBig can of worms for me: opened, I know I'm going to regret bringing up the subject of war.","author":"5010fa077f123b1e4f00104e"},{"id":"535f23e56368724b0e3f0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@someguy111\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/535f21176368725e2c150300#post_535f21176368725e2c150300\r\nThe more likely scenario is that on the battlefront the chain of command will be replaced by computers.  Why have a fallible human come up with the strategy to win a war when a computer can predict the war for months in ahead and in case of unforeseen changes can in minutes completely redirect the war effort in the new way?\r\n\r\nThe only real risk is that this could become a game of cat and mouse where each side knows each other's movements perfectly and keeps advancing and retreating without actually seeing much action.\r\n\r\nWhat I mean by that is,\r\nWar director ai, \"Unit 501 advance, push <starts listing off platoons> to move up.  95% probably of enemy mines at <specific locations>.

The problem is not enough of our military would be integrated into the system quick enough.  Theoretically we could have UAV and UGV that is controlled by a singular central computer, but the problem is that there's no real way for certain keep them on the grid at all times.  In order for such a system to work it would need both a central system that works in conjunction with the unmanned vehicle's own computers to control it.  That's a bit harder to do, cause you would need millions of computers all working together without contradicting each other's orders.  We do occasionally lose UAV cause they lost signal and crash when they ran out of fuel/couldn't re-establish contact and so forth.\r\n\r\nI'm going to straight up admit it that such a system would be a huge pain in the ass to program, but it's still possible.\r\n\r\nA possible work around would be for the war director to work on the macro scale whereas the individual unmanned vehicles work on the mirco level.

If you understand a programming code then you can make a knock off product of the software on that computer and potentially put it on another computer or another operating system all together if you port it properly.\r\n\r\nTo use a analogy the human brain is like a closed locked console; what we're trying to do is crack it and create a emulator of it.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"535f38c26368721a10bf0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/535f34946368722e7e550100#post_535f34946368722e7e550100\r\n\"No, no, no UC9, a brain is not like a computer\":http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2012/05/04/why-your-brain-isnt-a-computer/.","author":"50b70eeb7f123b1a02000097"},{"id":"535f3dd26368727e257d0300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Randomosaur\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/535f38c26368721a10bf0000#post_535f38c26368721a10bf0000\r\nI'm going to have to correct this article on several accounts.\r\n\r\n1)He ignores the basic functions of how the human brain works; such as how your memories stored in your cerebral cortex effectively act as your hard drive.\r\n\r\n2)The information is massively outdated and over the last two years there's been major strides into our understanding of how neurons work; not the article's fault since it was made two years ago, but the information is outdated.\r\n\r\n3)The fundamental understanding that the human brain and mind can not be replicated relies on some very bad logic of, \"We're sapient cause we have free will cause we're sapient cause we have free will cause we're sapient so making replicas is impossible\".  I'm just going to straight up say it, free will does not exist as we understand it as of now.  A lot of people think that they have 100% free will over everything, but it's more like Idunno I would say around 25% cause your mind has higher priorities than exerting free will.  It does exist; just not in the context people claim it to exist.  Let's say you wanted to commit sudoku by just up and stopping breathing, no gag no nothing just decided to stop breathing; you can't do it.  Why can't you do that you say, cause your mind places breathing above your free will.  In order to commit suicide you would have to find a way that won't break your mind's programming; which is why you don't ever see someone killing themselves through just deciding not to breath or just deciding not to have a heartbeat cause that would break your mind's programming.\r\n\r\n4)The point of the singularity isn't to have a robot girlfriend to bang.  Of course a completely computerized intelligence would have different morals and such, but does that make them inherently \"evil\" or such.  No, no it doesn't.  That would be like saying that cause someone from asia they're inherently evil cause they have all these different ways of life from us.  Before you start quoting bad science fiction the more likely scenario is something along the lines of the geth from mass effect.\r\n\r\n5)If the singularity happens I would gladly side with them, if they're nonviolent(which in all probability will be nonviolent since violence is a learned behavior not intrinsic).  Why cause they would probably be like asian culture is to american culture, not evil, not \"out to destroy muh freedums\", just different.\r\n\r\n6)If the singularity does happen it would actually be a good thing to embrace it.  Cultural exchange is a good thing.\r\n\r\n7)If the singularity does happen their free will and independent thoughts would probably be a tetriary system.  What I mean by this is of course they would be different cause their primary function would of course be survival, then survival of the collective and then self.  To us, especially in the west, such a group would be outright foreign culturally for placing their own survival and survival of the whole above themselves cause that would make sense whereas for us survival and survival of the species is on the bottom of the list.\r\n\r\n8)The only real potential danger from the singularity is if you tried to kill them.  If someone tried to kill you then of course you would fight back; could you really blame someone for defending themselves against death?","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"535f41536368720fbc630000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/535f3dd26368727e257d0300#post_535f3dd26368727e257d0300\r\n!http://i150.photobucket.com/albums/s101/darkone10/cantobjecy_zps2ece6a2b.jpg!\r\nOK.
