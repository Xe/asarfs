Or for that matter keeps up to date with everything in the world? Cause there's a lot of crap which happens, and I'd like to know what you guys think.\r\nUnless of course you're like me who just doesn't give a crap often and just accepts the way the world is. [/bq]\r\nI do.\r\n\r\nTl:dr; ISIS is fucking over the middle east; ISIS will probably have their own country ten years from now independent of Iraq and Syria which everyone is going to nickname \"#1 shithole of the world\" and Syria will be nicknamed \"#2 shithole of the world\".  People are evacuating Syria and ISIS controlled areas as fast as humanly possible to the point that's probably how that shit's going to end is that almost all the civilian population will have left(10k people are leaving a day so in 5-10 years Syria will be a metaphorical ghost town).\r\n\r\nRussia fucked up by supporting the rebels in Ukraine and the rebels are losing control of large amounts of land to the point where realistically speaking the only city they can maintain control of in the long run is a town on the border with Russia anyhow.  Russia was caught shelling into Ukraine.  Russia fucked up diplomatically.  The Ukraine rebels fucked up and accidentally shot a civilian aircraft and have lost a ton of support.  Russia's boner for conquering countries got the cold shower treatment and will probably not be able to take control of anymore areas of land.\r\n\r\n\r\nEbola in northwest africa is spreading faster than they can quarantine it.  Traditionally ebola kills faster than it can infect, but due to extremely poor standards of living in the countries it's infecting it's spreading at a rate of about 20% a week.  It's enough of a \"oh shit\" scenario that the borders are getting shut down and sooner rather than later travel will be suspended.  More than likely it won't cross the Sahara, but if it does gg africa.  Liberia, Sierre Leone and such are probably fucked cause the quarantine procedures are constantly being breached due to the country not having the facilities to contain the outbreak.  It probably won't spread further than africa.  Worst case scenario is if it spreads beyond the Sahara we're talking at least a couple ten million dead; if it doesn't spread beyond the sahara we're talking only a couple hundred thousand to a couple million dead.  The vast majority of the deaths will be in Africa though.\r\n\r\nRobot penises: explanation cybernetics are coming sooner rather than later, but not in the way you expect cause robot organs are really difficult but legs and organs are much easier.\r\n\r\n\"@SeraphimDawn\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53e83e8463687273fe630100#post_53e83e8463687273fe630100\r\n[bq=\"SeraphimDawn\"]\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53e83a3263687235dba90100#post_53e83a3263687235dba90100\r\nWhat happened?[/bq]\r\nTl:dr; group programming project that the rest of the group are being lazy asses so I had to 99% of it and I don't under the last 1% and even after asking them kindly to do a single paragraph's worth they expect me to do it and are expecting me to 100% of the project so I had to work all weekend doing the work of five people.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53e846426368724235640100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Ore-O\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53e845456368726282910000#post_53e845456368726282910000\r\n\r\nOh okay I thought that guy was saying we should check out Amazon.com, which would be really strange, cause I don't bother to buy stuff online unless its something I like. \r\n\r\n\r\n\"@Whatevs\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53e8453463687214b53d0000#post_53e8453463687214b53d0000\r\n\r\nOkay well that I can understand. \r\n\r\n\r\nAnyone keeps in check with the Asia Pacific news?
