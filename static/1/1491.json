Gospel music, many, many hymns, the majority of Christmas music that is actually fucking listenable and I'm sure more that I am forgetting.\r\n\r\nHowever as a rule when ever someone tries to make explicitly christian music of a more modern type it usually sucks balls. Usually.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this is quite simple really, expressly christian music comes from a much smaller talent pool than secular music and therefor there is a bit of a big fish in a small pond thing going on so odds are good that an extraordinary christian artist is in fact really just mediocre by the standards of that broader genre.\r\n\r\nHowever, and this is a big fat ugly however, musical tastes are mostly subjective and I argue that what is important in terms of music is what speaks to you personally.\r\n\r\nI know this because I lived it. For a long time all I listened to was christian music plus the odd secular album that I could sneak or that my parents, in fact usually my dad, also dug and I will always hold some fondness for the christian bands that got me into the types of music I love today.\r\n\r\n\"Zao\":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPeQGTDOr5g\r\n\"Blaster the Rocket Man\":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7xeOgs7nAs\r\n\"Five Iron Frenzy\":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NCfAO2ulBM","author":"4f41ee04945b701c41002af7"},{"id":"540d11386368721d354c0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@gasmaskangel\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/540d10ed63687229581b0100#post_540d10ed63687229581b0100\r\nyou know what music is great?
