Time for a recap.\r\n\r\nNaruto: I'd spoiler this part if anything actually happened. But nothing did. All that happened was Naruto and Sasuke talked about things we already know. Sasuke continues to be a self-righteous shitlord who is in desperate need of dying. It was literally a whole chapters worth of PADDING.\r\n\r\nBleach: [spoiler]Juhabach continues his invasion of the Soul Palace. Weird dual tongue lisp guy gets owned, and we're introduced to three new Quincy characters. Gerard Valkyire, Lille Barro, and Pernita Parnkgas. We also have a returning qunicy in the form of Askin Nakk Le Vaar. Weird Tailor Lady does some cool stuff and then gets owned. And that's pretty much it.[/spoiler]\r\n\r\nOne Piece is back!: [spoiler]Apparently Law's hometown had strange raw material called Amber Lead. And they used it to make all kinds of things and got really rich. Unfortunately Amber Lead is very toxic. Although the poison can't be passed from person to person and only by direct contact with Amber Lead. So the World Government in their _infinite wisdom_ decided to quarantine the entire country. And then murder everybody! And they wonder why everyone hates them. Also Law for some reason stabs Corazon in the back[/spoiler]\r\n\r\nToriko: [spoiler]Komatsu got royally curp-stomped and is now hooked to an artificial heart to stay alive. So Toriko, Coco, Sunny, and Zebra have to ride a shark train to fight a giant monkey.
