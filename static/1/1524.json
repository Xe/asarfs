So while I was fighting with the Jianists to the south they decided to force me to abdicate. I thought I picked the option to fight them, but when I look around I found the only other war I was involved in was a Holy War for Baluchistan, apparently started by my brother in question. As to be imagined, I was mighty confused.\r\n \r\nBut then I realized I was now longer Samrat, but a Raj myself. Evidently I picked the option to voluntarily abdicate from the title of Samrat. So with the war I started almost finished I shrugged it off, won that, and was content I was still a Raj, and not the Hindu equivalent of a count.\r\n \r\nAnyways, some time later there was put into play a faction to force my brother off the throne and re-instate me as the Samrat of Rajastan. They informed me - as they should - and I waited for the fireworks.\r\n \r\nSamrat Artemis dully abdicated the throne with no fuss to allow the Second Reign of Samrat Big Macintosh. By Siva they know who rules. Shortly afterwards I think he died because he wasn't ruling as the Raj of Sindh, his son was.","author":"4fe4bf947f123b175b000001"},{"id":"541105496368723c2d680100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Number1pegasus\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5411050b6368724451ca0000#post_5411050b6368724451ca0000\r\nI will miss that guy.","author":"31bee2686368722a0df23600"},{"id":"5411055663687239384a0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Number1pegasus\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/541103186368725f19030100#post_541103186368725f19030100\r\nhe MAY have come back to life.
