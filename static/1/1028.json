I think what the guy was going for was hoping that the police cars couldn't turn sharp enough corners and that he could use that spare time to get some distance.  You can see two of the cars having trouble turning that hard.  A better strategy would have been to done a hard turn at a faster speed.  The police cars would have hit a building instead with that little time to react or force them to slow down and then turn.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53dae14863687273f2140200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@twistedmetalero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53dade886368720c3c2c0000#post_53dade886368720c3c2c0000\r\n\r\nI think I love the Sonic fandom.","author":"500757fd7f123b75a90003b1"},{"id":"53dae1bc6368721920310200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"what do you guys think of this non hip hop song\":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxFb12EJRQM","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"53dae21463687251e3540000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@twistedmetalero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53dae1bc6368721920310200#post_53dae1bc6368721920310200\r\ns'alright.","author":"500757fd7f123b75a90003b1"},{"id":"53dae309636872460b230200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53dae11b63687257cb4d0200#post_53dae11b63687257cb4d0200\r\nI'm losing it.
