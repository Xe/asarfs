If it's neither of these it's either the power supply or I don't know.\r\n\r\nOh also if it's a series of beeps instead of a singular beep or a long beep that's normally a ram stick gave out.  Normally in this case it's a series of four beeps(normally), if that's the case take out all the ram sticks then insert them one by one until you figured out which one is broken.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"535aa7116368720c4a770000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/535aa5656368725f1da60000#post_535aa5656368725f1da60000\r\n There is no beeps, it stays there with a black screen.\r\n\r\nI disconnected everything but still nothing","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"535aa7646368720296750000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@twistedmetalero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/535aa7116368720c4a770000#post_535aa7116368720c4a770000\r\nIt's a corrupted bios.\r\n\r\nGoogle your computer model and \"bios\" and follow the steps.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"535aa7d56368723993a20200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/535aa7646368720296750000#post_535aa7646368720296750000\r\n\r\nWhere do i see my pc model","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"535aa80d6368727ff4150100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@twistedmetalero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/535aa7d56368723993a20200#post_535aa7d56368723993a20200\r\nIt should be on your computer tower, unless you removed the stickers.\r\n\r\nIf you did then you're in for a world of hurt.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"535aac1463687259884e0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/535aa80d6368727ff4150100#post_535aa80d6368727ff4150100\r\nThe model i got is rather anbiguous, i mean it says its 1005 900 0037\r\n\r\nBut none of the post involve most of these numbers together, they mostl1y  are asus EEEE 1005H.","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"535aad2a63687274e5cb0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@twistedmetalero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/535aac1463687259884e0100#post_535aac1463687259884e0100\r\nOkay; what brand of computer is it?","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"535aad6863687224171d0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/535aad2a63687274e5cb0000#post_535aad2a63687274e5cb0000\r\n\r\nCompumax\r\n\r\nForeing","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"535aae8f6368725988730200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@twistedmetalero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/535aad6863687224171d0000#post_535aad6863687224171d0000\r\nI'm talking about is it a hp, dell or such; not who refurbished it.\r\n\r\nIf it doesn't list that then you're pretty screwed and will pretty much have to take it to a computer repair store.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"535aaec36368724900140000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/535aae8f6368725988730200#post_535aae8f6368725988730200\r\n\r\nAsus","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"535ab02a6368722441b80100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@twistedmetalero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/535aaec36368724900140000#post_535aaec36368724900140000\r\nIs this your computer?\r\nhttp://www.asus.com/Notebooks_Ultrabooks/Eee_PC_1005HA_Seashell/","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"535ab13f63687254bfec0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/535ab02a6368722441b80100#post_535ab02a6368722441b80100\r\nNo, mine is desktop and all black","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"535ab1d163687254bf350100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@twistedmetalero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/535ab13f63687254bfec0000#post_535ab13f63687254bfec0000\r\nWell here comes the fun part that will leave you wanting a drink; go to the asus site I just listed and scroll through every desktop to find your model.\r\n\r\nI tried to help you, but without a picture of it you're going to have to do it the hard way and look through every model of computer they've made. . .
