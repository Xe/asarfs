Not just based on the Dark-Dark Fruit, but the fact he's got other powers going for him is why Teech will not be an easy enemy.\r\n\r\nBTW, nice idea on the Pen-Pen Fruit. I had one for a guy in the Marines/Navy for the One Piece RP my pal Kurt and I are working on; it's called the Ground-Ground Fruit, a Logia-Type which allows the person who has its powers, Turks Sol, the leader of a black ops unit called the Black Clouds, to control the earth itself and make parts of his body into earth. Like the Sand-Sand Fruit however, liquids are a weakness for him besides the general fact of all Devil Fruit weaknesses.","author":"5056c9e87f123b37f6012a34"},{"id":"5438321e636872124c6c0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I had a dream about one of my teeth falling out.
