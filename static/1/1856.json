I fear that if it were to end, things won't ever be the same again. She was always there, someone I could count on. Then all this happened, and I couldn't say no. Doing so would only drive her away. I had no choice. Now, I feel like I already have fallen for her. But I'm scared that if something happens, I might never get her back. \r\n\r\nRight now, seeing her smile just be herself, I feel a sense of security. As is nothing bad will happen. But there's always that bad ending, that probability. I just can't let that happen. I won't let it.\r\n\r\nSorry, just something I needed to get of my chest.","author":"52f0834d63687261cba90300"},{"id":"5436af1463687245d77d0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Albus Fahrenheits\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5436ae3a63687278f5a30000#post_5436ae3a63687278f5a30000\r\nThat feeling means you're in love dude.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5436b0d56368720e98820200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"waiting for a hotline miami game where they dont kick me, or the game doesnt allow me to join for some shitty reason.","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"5436b0ea6368727a23ca0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Albus Fahrenheits\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5436ae3a63687278f5a30000#post_5436ae3a63687278f5a30000\r\n\r\nthats sweet, love is in the air.\r\n\r\n>tfw you will never feel love cause you are an empty shell of a person.","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"5436bff263687233f3600100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Albus Fahrenheits\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5436ae3a63687278f5a30000#post_5436ae3a63687278f5a30000\r\n\r\nNo worries, Albus.
