I’m sick of all this “Masterwork Bastard Sword” bullshit that’s going on in the d20 system right now. Katanas deserve much better than that. Much, much better than that.\r\n\r\nI should know what I’m talking about. I myself commissioned a genuine katana in Japan for 2,400,000 Yen (that’s about $20,000) and have been practicing with it for almost 2 years now. I can even cut slabs of solid steel with my katana.\r\n\r\nJapanese smiths spend years working on a single katana and fold it up to a million times to produce the finest blades known to mankind.\r\n\r\nKatanas are thrice as sharp as European swords and thrice as hard for that matter too. Anything a longsword can cut through, a katana can cut through better. I’m pretty sure a katana could easily bisect a knight wearing full plate with a simple vertical slash.\r\n\r\nEver wonder why medieval Europe never bothered conquering Japan? That’s right, they were too scared to fight the disciplined Samurai and their katanas of destruction. Even in World War II, American soldiers targeted the men with the katanas first because their killing power was feared and respected.\r\n\r\nSo what am I saying? Katanas are simply the best sword that the world has ever seen, and thus, require better stats in the d20 system. Here is the stat block I propose for Katanas:\r\n\r\n(One-Handed Exotic Weapon)\r\n\r\n1d12 Damage\r\n19-20 x4 Crit\r\n+2 to hit and damage\r\nCounts as Masterwork\r\n\r\n(Two-Handed Exotic Weapon)\r\n\r\n2d10 Damage\r\n17-20 x4 Crit\r\n+5 to hit and damage\r\nCounts as Masterwork\r\n\r\nNow that seems a lot more representative of the cutting power of Katanas in real life, don’t you think?","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"542b5ff063687262c1e50000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I had Spaghetti!","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"542b600763687233d00c0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/542b5ff063687262c1e50000#post_542b5ff063687262c1e50000\r\n\r\n*Tips fedora*","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"542b60226368724f24140000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@QuasarNova\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/542b600763687233d00c0100#post_542b600763687233d00c0100\r\nNo. None of that.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"542b602d63687220c8730100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@twistedmetalero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/542b5d786368725858660000#post_542b5d786368725858660000\r\nThat's why I prefer machetes.\r\n\r\n!http://www.imfdb.org/images/thumb/7/7b/MA-MACHETES.jpg/600px-MA-MACHETES.jpg!","author":"5239db6da4c72d22d9000358"},{"id":"542b605b63687220e5bb0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@PaskaNaakka\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/542b5c5e636872029bb80000#post_542b5c5e636872029bb80000\r\n\r\n\"What happened here?\":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVCaJdYZmCU\r\n\r\nI'd either use a Russian Shashka or a Chinese Da Dao.","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"542b60dc636872032fee0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Shadow_the_Hedgehog\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/542b602d63687220c8730100#post_542b602d63687220c8730100\r\n\r\n!http://weknowmemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/story-time-with-danny-trejo.jpg!","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"542b61096368724f244b0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@QuasarNova\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/542b60dc636872032fee0100#post_542b60dc636872032fee0100\r\nDanny Trejo is the fucking coolest.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"542b612163687263c2d10000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Shadow_the_Hedgehog\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/542b5a5963687225b2a60100#post_542b5a5963687225b2a60100\r\nWell my teeth and grasping hands should be enough to drag survivors to a grisly fate.","author":"4f41ee04945b701c41002af7"},{"id":"542b619263687202df7b0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/542b5ff063687262c1e50000#post_542b5ff063687262c1e50000\r\n[bq=\"SquiggyBomb\"]I had Spaghetti![/bq]\r\n\r\n\r\n\"@QuasarNova\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/542b600763687233d00c0100#post_542b600763687233d00c0100\r\n[bq=\"QuasarNova\"]\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/542b5ff063687262c1e50000#post_542b5ff063687262c1e50000\r\n\r\n*Tips fedora*[/bq]\r\n\r\nnice meme","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"542b61dc6368724ef68a0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"So what were my pets up to while their master was away?","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"542b62866368720924420000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@gasmaskangel\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/542b612163687263c2d10000#post_542b612163687263c2d10000\r\n\r\n!http://elblogdelmacho.com/sites/default/files/u74/rick-machete.jpg!","author":"5239db6da4c72d22d9000358"},{"id":"542b63366368722e2a120000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SeraphimDawn\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/542b605b63687220e5bb0100#post_542b605b63687220e5bb0100\r\nPolearms > Swords anyway","author":"5007bbdf7f123b112f00023a"},{"id":"542b636a6368722dab0d0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/542b61dc6368724ef68a0000#post_542b61dc6368724ef68a0000\r\n\r\nDiscovered the weirdeist thing I've seen \r\n\r\nSecond Life Viewer","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"542b637c6368724ef6ca0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@PaskaNaakka\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/542b63366368722e2a120000#post_542b63366368722e2a120000\r\nAxes>Every Melee Weapon Ever.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"542b63ab6368724e84cc0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Hey guys, why are we talking about Zombie apocalypses?
