That doesn't make him a good character.\r\nEverything that happens to him is his own damn fault and he's gonna drag down the world for his petty revenge. There's also that Kratos is TOO masculine. The point of character action is to be fun. When the character acts like he's too macho for fun then he can just fuck off. That's one of the MANY reasons I adore Bayonetta as a character. SHE is having as much fun as the player.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"5438e3ae6368720f4b8a0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5438e3376368724a565b0000#post_5438e3376368724a565b0000\r\n\r\nthe machos that have fun tho\r\n\r\n!http://www.vadejuegos.com/imagenes/2012/12/23/serious-sam-3-cover.jpg!\r\n\r\n","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"5438e4916368724544720100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@twistedmetalero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5438e3ae6368720f4b8a0100#post_5438e3ae6368720f4b8a0100\r\nAnother reason I love Bayo. She is so fucking feminine. She fusses over her hair, she carries around make-up, she flirts more than I do, and despite all that femininity kicks ALL KINDS of angelic ass.

A chain had pierced his curious little right buttock and he whimpered beautifully with the pain.\r\n\r\n\"My manly little friend, \" Snape said. \"Let me help you!\" He took out his Leatherman Multi-Purpose tool and pulled out the chain, as slowly as he could. The ferret cried out and Snape's heart ached, as if a volcanic eruption had buried Hogwarts in pudding and liquid lust. \"You'll be all right, \" Snape whispered. \"I'll take care of you. I'll call you Draco and you can live with me forever!\"\r\n\r\nScooping Draco up in his arms, Snape carried him home and made a bed for him beside his own. For seven days and seven nights, Snape nursed Draco, cleaning his right buttock and feeding him Chandelier-brand ferret chow.\r\n\r\nOn the eighth night, Draco climbed into bed with Snape. He burrowed under the covers and wetly absorbed Snape's chin. It made Snape giggle and he cuddled close to Draco, stroking his earlobe and singing forbiddenly to him.\r\n\r\nThey continued that way for a long time. Every day, Snape hurried home so he could curl up with Draco. It gave him a mischievous feeling whenever Draco absorbed his chin.\r\n\r\nThen one night, Draco looked up at Snape and said, \"If you kiss me, I will become a bruised prince.\"\r\n\r\nSnape screamed agonizingly, he was so surprised. How could a ferret talk? He must have dropped off and dreamed it.\r\n\r\n\"You're not dreaming, \" Draco said. \"Kiss me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't tell anyone I screamed like that, \" Snape said and kissed Draco on his earlobe. The air swirled and suddenly, there stood a bruised prince! With a crown and everything!\r\n\r\n\"I'm Prince Draco, \" he said. \"I was cursed. It's a long story.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it really you?\" Snape said.\r\n\r\n\"See?\" Draco said and showed Snape the scar from the chain on his right buttock. Then he kissed Snape and they tumbled under the table and did a lot of very long-awaited things, some of them involving a smooth napkin.\r\n\r\n\"I love you, \" Draco said when they were done. Snape clasped him close and they lived together happily ever after on all the prince treasure Draco had stashed away.\r\nAnd if Draco didn't know about Snape's visits to the ferret sanctuary, well, it wouldn't hurt him.[/spoiler]","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"5438e822636872035d080200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"How to cause a internet fight in one image:\r\n!http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/755/897/8a6.png!","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5438e9256368726caa2a0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5438e822636872035d080200#post_5438e822636872035d080200\r\nThat's what dakimakura are for!","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"5438edf16368720338380200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Anyone else still on?","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5438ee606368727a15b20000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5438edf16368720338380200#post_5438edf16368720338380200\r\n\r\nyes\r\n\r\n!https://33.media.tumblr.com/b18162225ab330cbbe77156ac7101112/tumblr_n2f2bbpoa81s3pjkwo1_500.png!","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"5438efbc6368726021ee0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5438edf16368720338380200#post_5438edf16368720338380200\r\nYep.
