The Ebola outbreak in Africa is probably going to continue to get way worse.  If you're wondering why basically the people quarantined give no shits and are storming through quarantine barriers.

It sounds really mean and cruel, but if there was a outbreak in the USA as well and there was a outbreak in your neighborhood you would get your butt quarantined as well.\r\n\r\nThis is why I think the ebola outbreak is going to get bad because no one seems to give a shit about quarantine procedures in the infected countries.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53f4efcd636872110bdb0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53f4e9bd63687257783a0100#post_53f4e9bd63687257783a0100\r\n!http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100619130521/ed_/images/f/f2/Quarantine.jpg!\r\nWhat Africa will be like in days to come.","author":"505696b47f123b37e800effa"},{"id":"53f505a46368725d98fc0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Is it just me or has there been a lot of Drama lately?","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"53f50dac636872111a320200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53f505a46368725d98fc0100#post_53f505a46368725d98fc0100\r\nIt wavers on and off.
