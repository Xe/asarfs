The Italian Merchant Republics would often row their ships up next to each other, secure the two, then fight on giant floatsam of blood and violence until everyone died.\r\n\r\nAnd there was no retreat, you'd fight or drown. There's no third-way. They followed the ancient traditions set down by the Greeks and Romans.\r\n\r\nHell, ramming and boarding again became a thing at the advent of armored battleships in the late 19th century. There's a few battles (in particular the \"Battle of Lissa\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Lissa_(1866) between Austria and Italy) where both navies were trying to ram each other. The invention of the ironclad sort of made guns irrelevant again when shells could rarely pierce armor, so ships just sort of became floating artillery pieces for lighter ships or landing support, they had to otherwise drive right into each other to be effective.\r\n\r\nOnce Armor Piercing and High Explosive ordinance came into the mainstream, ramming went out as a conventional tactic and was only used a few times since, I think mostly as the last or a desperate act.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd since I invoked the Battle of Lisa I just got to invoke this painting on Anton Romako:\r\n\r\n!https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/Anton_Romako_001.jpg!","author":"4fe4bf947f123b175b000001"},{"id":"534b63ed6368720959330000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@AaronMk\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/534b63ad6368722b42730100#post_534b63ad6368722b42730100\r\nSo basically bum rush the mother fuckers?","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"534b64c76368722c1b070000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"hell, everything odd future makes its just so incredibly senseless.\r\n\r\n!http://www.phawker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/earl.png! \r\n!http://www.highsnobiety.com/files/2013/02/Tyler-the-Creator-Announces-Wolf-Album-New-Video-Tour-Dates-and-Much-More-featured-image.jpg! \r\n!http://exclaim.ca/images/oddfuture.jpg! \r\n!http://www.ahoodie.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/TRON-CAT-WILLLIN-TWTTER-HEADER.jpg! \r\n!http://23.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l21pyvSfjb1qbe04wo1_cover.png!

In the Battle of Lissa the Austrians beat the Italians despite being outnumbered two-to-one, but that's because they had managed to get the Italian force divided and they became very ineffective. And when the \"main\" part of the battle happened the Austrians managed to get the Italian force down enough that they out numbered them.\r\n\r\nYou also got the internal politics going on within the navies. The two guys in command of the Italian effort basically hated each other and one refused to join the battle because he hated the other so much.","author":"4fe4bf947f123b175b000001"},{"id":"534b7364636872776c870000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"i was just watching regular show, and man i just noticed they got childish gambino and tyler the creator for their rap battles.","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"534c196f636872736acf0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"We are going to have a total lunar eclipse tonight.
