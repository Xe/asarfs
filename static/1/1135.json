Even when this is over. Hasbro *will* find ways to keep the franchise going. They could make a new generation. But they could also use FiM and G4 design's reputation to build on, without wasting too much effort and risking another G3 scale flop on trying to make something completely new. Due to G4's success, I can totally see them try to use whatever Faust and the DHX team provided them with as a reference.\r\n\r\nMaybe they could extend G4's life by making a sequel to the current FiM series.

Other toy makers are subsidiaries of other larger companies; like how disney owns several toy companies; whereas companies like Toys-R-Us and such had to have their stocks pulled.\r\n\r\nWhat is probably going to happen in the long run is that Hasbro is going to have the same thing happen to them in the long run; their stocks will diminish due to people just don't buy as many toys nowadays and then they're going to get bought out and be pulled from the stock market.\r\n\r\n\r\nObviously another generation to MLP will probably come about eventually but if you're expecting it to just get popped out right after FIM you're barking up the wrong tree.
