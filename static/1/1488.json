Some due this by pandering to political bias (like MSNBC and Fox News) others by latching onto anything even vaguely shocking and then hyping it up to its most extreme possible lengths (like literally every major US news outlet).\r\n\r\nNow, in this case the story is probably true. The Daily Mail is in no way exaggerating the claims of Dr. Jari Louhelainen who has been apparently talking to everyone about this (just read interviews he gave with a couple other newspapers and listened to one he gave on BBC radio), however I'd still advise against taking anything printed in a British newspaper with more than a grain of salt.\r\n\r\nMy reason? Well simply that this story happens to hit all the highlights they look to for clickbait. Its about horrible murder, and an unsolved mystery. The only way it could be more right up their alley was if they could somehow work pedophilia and the decay of society at the hands of X (X being literally anything not completely British) into it.","author":"4f41ee04945b701c41002af7"},{"id":"540cab666368722c003d0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@twistedmetalero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/540ca6fc6368723469ae0000#post_540ca6fc6368723469ae0000\r\nOh that is some sweet, sweet wrongness right there.","author":"4f41ee04945b701c41002af7"},{"id":"540cabb56368720f09270100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@gasmaskangel\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/540cab666368722c003d0000#post_540cab666368722c003d0000\r\nand as i recall\r\nthe guy who did the first one, did it because someone said inb4 porn","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"540cac32636872707c4d0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@gasmaskangel\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/540cab3a6368724408510100#post_540cab3a6368724408510100\r\noh I know how biased they are. Which is why I am not perturbed by the Mail. If I recall correctly the other papers are state owned and tried their own scaremongering with UKIP (usual stuff: racist, homophobic, sexist) and did not report Rotherham (which is more disgusting than anything the mail has done imo).\r\nAnd to be honest, the new information about most of ISIS's foreign combatants being from Britain has shaken my previous positions on the role of multiculturalism.\r\n\r\nAnd I googled the scientist a bit and saw that the story seemed legit. And if it wasn't he could go to another paper who would run the story to get clickbait bashing the mail.
