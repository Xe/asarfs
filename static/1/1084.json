It is my hope that I do not behave in such a fashion. I know I have spoken out of anger or just off the cuff here and in other places, and I do hope that people will call me out when I'm full of shit as it is the only way to learn and test the ideas and opinions I value.\r\n\r\n*Note: While I am critical of Yahtzee, I do in fact enjoy his videos about half the time.","author":"4f41ee04945b701c41002af7"},{"id":"53e194a76368727e21220000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@gasmaskangel\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53e1942363687230fc810100#post_53e1942363687230fc810100\r\nThis is a BIG problem with indie devs. ESPECIALLY on Steam.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"53e194f56368721977310100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53e194a76368727e21220000#post_53e194a76368727e21220000\r\nOh yes.
