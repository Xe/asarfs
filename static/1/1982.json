Also having discord play a non-villain role would be interesting, if he was neutral, and he still tricked ponies. That'd be in character for him. \r\n\r\nOr like Sombra, or Queen Chrysalis, there's a lot of stuff to add in which would make interesting content, no shipping or heavy shipping required.

Everyone likes how is now, and a complete change of all the fic will not be the same.  That's why side stories are for. Also the ending, well I haven't reached to the ending, so I don't much of it.\r\n\r\nThere waa actually a plan to continue the original fic with FoE:2, but something happened and the fic will not be made.\r\n\r\nLike I said, Discord appeared in Proyect Horizonts as neutral, but he waa in \"statue state\". [spoiler]He got his freedom thanks by Blackjack and in the end, he kiss her...yes.\r\n..and disappears.[/spoiler]\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, I prefer Fallout Equestria how it is, without changes.
