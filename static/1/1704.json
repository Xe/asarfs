So what's the problem? People all the time dismiss The Hunchback of Notre Dame because of the differences from the novel but again, it's a fantastic movie.\r\nAnd I personally think that Claude Frollo is more interesting in the Disney movie than in the novel.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"5425be996368727b498d0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5425bc606368727d842d0000#post_5425bc606368727d842d0000\r\nYOU ARE SUFFERING THE SAME THING LIKE ME!\r\nAHHHHHH!!!","author":"5239db6da4c72d22d9000358"},{"id":"5425bf3c6368727aadb40000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5425bc606368727d842d0000#post_5425bc606368727d842d0000\r\nWhen were Disney movies ever \"right\" on anything?\r\n\r\n\"This music\":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-ufwFBDXuc summarizes my state of mind every weekend afternoon.\r\n","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"5425bfbc6368727af5420000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5425be3b6368722059300000#post_5425be3b6368722059300000\r\nYeah. Plus pretty much any disney movie based on an existing story is altered a lot. Little mermaid, jungle book, anything based on a grimm story. All pretty fucked up in the source material. \r\n\r\nMaybe it bugs me more because I'm more invested in greek mythology. Which ironically was sparked by watching disney's hercules as a kid. \r\n\r\nAlso, I've yet to read the original hunchback of notre dame but I agree that Frollo is such an amazing villain in the disney version. There's parts where it seems like the movie is more about him than quasimodo.","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"5425bfc46368727219250200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SeraphimDawn\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5425bf3c6368727aadb40000#post_5425bf3c6368727aadb40000\r\nPochantas should be a clue.","author":"505696b47f123b37e800effa"},{"id":"5425c02b6368724e3b3b0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5425bfbc6368727af5420000#post_5425bfbc6368727af5420000\r\nI still don't get how that movie has a G rating.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"5425c07e6368724ba0380000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5425bfbc6368727af5420000#post_5425bfbc6368727af5420000\r\n\r\n!http://media.tumblr.com/12130248c6a404e1e7c072023f83a167/tumblr_inline_mldod3JjBL1qz4rgp.jpg!","author":"5239db6da4c72d22d9000358"},{"id":"5425c09763687214ae8b0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Seriously, one if the major conflicts of the movie is Frollo wanting to fuck a gypsy.
