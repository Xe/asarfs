I have no words: guess what bullshit is going on?  You know back in the old days how they would throw you in prison if you couldn't pay your bills and shit?  Well we're seeing a return to this in local governments for being unable to pay things like parking tickets, fees and such.  I know someone on here is going to say a dissenting opinion, but here's a the immediate problem with this \"how can individuals work to pay off those fees if they're in prison?\"   The second problem with this is that if a individual is in prison for not paying parking tickets and can only get a job in prison that pays $.05 a day and they have to pay off a $500 fee and every month the payment is late there's late fees wouldn't that fall under forced servitude?\r\n\r\nShit like this is already massively illegal, but for fuck's sakes I would think the court systems would know the laws.  A official in Colorado got in trouble for this shit and when asked about it he talked about how much more revenue it brought in. . . So let me get this straight your job as a member of the judicial system is to enforce the laws but not actually know the laws? The only word that fits this is \"dumbass\".","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"540f52216368722082f00000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/540f51a963687227d7090000#post_540f51a963687227d7090000\r\n\r\nYou would love my country uc.

Basically the way prisons work in 'murrica is that it's pretty much a business in that local governments, state governments and federal prisons want more prisoners in that they receive more funding.  The problem with this is that local governments and state governments have massive amounts of revenue come in through driving fees and such.  When self driving cars come out there goes that revenue.  (I have to go to a class and get lunch so I'll summarize)  Self-driving cars come out -> No more such thing as driving fines -> Massive numbers of cops get laid off -> Massive reduction in revenue for court system -> Prison system collapses cause they can no longer afford to imprison people for drug charges, fines, \"resisting arrest\" and other things that should be handle differently -> Only violent and dangerous criminals are able to be housed anymore such as murders, rapists and such -> Self driving cars massively reduce accidents -> Massively reduces insurance costs(we're talking down to a tenth of what it is now) -> Massively reduces number of people driving without insurance -> Massively reduces number of driving fines -> Compounding collapse of prison complex -> Drastically reduces number of prisoners.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"540f56586368723e0a120200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@ParagonCommander\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/540f55786368726697880000#post_540f55786368726697880000\r\n\r\n[spoiler]That's a good challenge actually[/spoiler]\r\n\r\nNo, that's more like a frown.
