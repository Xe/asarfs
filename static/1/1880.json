Red and black grapes contain the phytochemical resveratrol, a powerful antioxidant thought to help protect against coronary disease, some cancers and viral infections. But eating too many grapes—or even just a few if you are sensitive to them—can cause nausea and diarrhea. Reason: Grapes are high in fructose, a natural sugar that often causes gas. Green grapes contain a lot of tannins, like green tea, which can lead to stomach upset.\r\nWhat to do: Eat only a small amount of grapes, or avoid them altogether if you are sensitive to them. Instead, try eating other fruits rich in resveratrol, such as cranberries, blueberries and bilberries.","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"543a1b25636872175df90000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"i should be the actual trap though","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"543a1b7c6368727ae4a60000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Albus Fahrenheits\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/543a1afa63687219fa700000#post_543a1afa63687219fa700000\r\nNicknames are always a good thing.
