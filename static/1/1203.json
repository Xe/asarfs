Yeah; they got wiped out.  The moral of this is don't try to start shit by sending your forces into a foreign country when the USA is giving the country you're trying to start shit in exact locations of your forces in that country.\r\n\r\nIf you're wondering what I mean by this is that the USA right now is sort of helping Ukraine by giving satellite images and locations of rebel forces as well as telling them where Russian forces in Ukraine are positioned at.  In other words: Russia sends troops into Ukraine -> USA tells Ukraine where those Russian troops are in Ukraine -> Ukraine bombs them.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53ee8c616368726783970000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Anyway\r\n!http://image.rakuten.co.jp/amiami/cabinet/images/2012/18/toy-tok-2509.jpg?_ex=128x128!\r\nUltra Hawk #2\r\n\r\n!http://i9.photobucket.com/albums/a51/xiombarg001/ship1.jpg!\r\nGun Phoenix\r\n\r\n!http://www.collectiondx.com/files/EX_GOKIN_TAGARROW_PANZER_1_NOV2012_ARTSTORM_14800_3.jpg!\r\nTAC Arrow\r\n\r\n!http://static.hlj.com/images/poa/poa38091_0.jpg!\r\nZAT Condor","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"53ee8db76368723019e80000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53ee8b8863687256bc9b0100#post_53ee8b8863687256bc9b0100\r\nIn other news, 'murica is stationing tanks in the baltics as a response to Russia's dickery.","author":"5007bbdf7f123b112f00023a"},{"id":"53ee9105636872502db90000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53ee7e7f6368722b6d3d0000#post_53ee7e7f6368722b6d3d0000\r\nwatching ursa's disney video now\r\nshe's so cute","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"53ee921063687267dd460100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://i.gyazo.com/d65c5ccc996334296664139697c213a1.png!","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"53ee927963687267b9900100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://i.imgur.com/EnGrsRk.jpg!\r\n\r\ncreepy mother fucker","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"53ee93c26368720a8a560100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53ee927963687267b9900100#post_53ee927963687267b9900100\r\nJEH JAGGAH FO' GODZILLA 3 ","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"53ee9454636872376d1a0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Pop question for hilarity sake:\r\nA genie gives you once wish that you have to use for the benefit of the human race, but the other catch is that it has to be something along the lines of something both selfish of you and something in line with what sort of person you are; like trashboat becoming a kamen rider to fight justice or something like that.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53ee949863687277d8040000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53ee93c26368720a8a560100#post_53ee93c26368720a8a560100\r\nomg i didn't even know they were making a Godzilla 2 till just now\r\nhell yes [spoiler]Ghidorah, The Three-Headed Monster remake, essentially[/spoiler]\r\n\r\nyes Jet Jaguar and Mecha for 3","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"53ee94af6368727d62f40100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53ee9454636872376d1a0100#post_53ee9454636872376d1a0100\r\n\r\nMonopoly of the cures for cancer and diabetes","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"53ee94db6368722f0a920100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://i.4cdn.org/mu/1408142654888.jpg!","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"53ee950c63687241d74d0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53ee9454636872376d1a0100#post_53ee9454636872376d1a0100\r\nIf I were to become a Kamen rider, I would prefer a Heisei one.
