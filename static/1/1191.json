It hurts my brain. [/bq]\r\nTl:dr of how to play and minus all the math; if you try to be Leeroy Jenkins you're going to die.\r\nTake out the minions first, bob and weave out of enemy champions attack radius, when you're on a turret push fucking hard until you're down to your last minion but book it when the last one is about to get shot/a enemy champion shows up/you're almost out of minions and more show up.\r\n\r\nIf you can't take out a enemy champion and more show up run.\r\nFocus on one champion at a time and whoever is lowest.\r\nSave your ult or ingite for when they're down to their last bit of health.\r\n\r\nWhat I tend to do as Ahri is wait for them to be down to 40-50% health, orb of deception them, fox-fire so that it knocks them down a bit before I pop spirit rush, spirit rush, charm to stop them from running, spirit rush, spirit rush and if they're low enough then finish them off with ignite and if they're getting away flash.\r\n\r\nGenerally you want to wait for the enemy champion to be under 50% to use your ult because of how long it takes to recharge.  The number one mistake new players make is popping their R button when their health is too high.\r\n\r\nI would suggest Ryze for new players.\r\n\r\nTl:dr; play it safe, only when a turret is down to 10% or a enemy champion is under 40-50% health do you go Leeroy Jenkins on them.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53ec64db63687229a85c0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://sickr.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/bayonetta.jpg?w=1038&h=576&crop=1!\r\nIs it weird that my first thoughts when seeing this were \"Her gun is too small\"?","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"53ec65886368721b98970000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://0-media-cdn.foolz.us/ffuuka/board/m/image/1394/07/1394070029094.png!\r\nSun Vulcan Transcends the Boundaries of Logic and reality.","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"53ec65a3636872298b4b0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53ec63fe63687213b2760100#post_53ec63fe63687213b2760100\r\nBRAIN HURTY","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"53ec65b56368722c4c780000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53ec64db63687229a85c0100#post_53ec64db63687229a85c0100\r\nConsidering you orientation, then no.
