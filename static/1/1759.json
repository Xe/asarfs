Why would an axe be better than swords? I mean a sword is a lot more lighter to use, sure you wouldn't want to get hit by an axe, but axes are unwieldy at times. A sword you can use with finesse, its also a bit more flexible when needed.

Of course that'd be difficult to cut with a sword, the point of a sword was intended more for fighting flesh and blood, not chopping down trees which are like a meter thick.\r\n\r\nWell that and swords vary from type, seriously, some can match an axe in sheer force. But keep this in mind, an axe does blunt more easily, since they're in constant use. Also they can't punch through chainmail armour, leather yes, but not chaimnail, you'd be better off with a polearm.
