It was extremely heated and a bunch of us were in different technologies; even though everyone was intelligent and debating in a rational manner you could tell everyone wanted to strangle each other.\r\n\r\nWe were talking about chips that simulate brain cells and jeez it got heated:\r\nThe roboticist wanted neurochips(I know that's not the technical term, but the technical term is fucking long) to reduce labor costs, increase production, increase safety and promote the economy through exponentially lower costs.\r\n\r\nThe economist didn't want neurochips cause we have no economic model to handle the changes it'll bring and they'll lose their jobs cause robots will run businesses financially instead.\r\n\r\nThe business major wanted the chips cause it would reduce production costs and drastically increase profits.\r\n\r\nThe digital forensics, basically a computer cop, hated the idea of it because things like self-driving cars, computers that can actively prevent intrusions without humans(basically imagine a chip on your computer that can prevent hack attacks), computers controlling finances reducing poverty would decrease crime and negatively effect the judicial system's budget and could by proxy very well could put him out of a job.\r\n\r\nThe business programmer was on the fence cause while it would drastically reduce the number of hours needed by programmers to do something, thus reducing the workforce, it would drastically make things easier programming wise if the computer can automatically find programming errors, syntax errors, typos and fix them.\r\n\r\nThey got super pissed at each other too.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"542726576368726be35b0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/542725a56368726f5d2c0100#post_542725a56368726f5d2c0100\r\nProbably.
