Recently, Iggy posted in a long string of tweets: “Special msg for banks: There are many black artists succeeding in all genres. The reason you haven’t is because of your piss poor attitude. Your inability to be responsible for your own mistakes, bullying others, the inability to be humble or have self control. It’s YOU! you created your own unfortunate situation by being a bigot and don’t have the mental capacity to realize yet. Probably never will. Now! rant, Make it racial! make it political! Make it whatever but I guarantee it won’t make you likable & THATS why ur crying on the radio. Enjoy continuing to bang your head against that metaphoric brick wall & Savor this attention. I’m the only way you get ANY. You’re poisonous and I feel genuinely sorry for you because it’s obvious at this point you are a MISERABLE, angry human being. Regards!”\r\nAnonymous then threatened Iggy, posting screenshots of racist tweets and sending out tweets such as..\r\n“You are guilty of misappropriating black culture, insulting peaceful protesters, and making light of Eric Garner’s death. @IGGYAZALEA”\r\n“MESSAGE: @IGGYAZALEA, you have exactly 48 hours from now to release a statement apologizing to @AzealiaBanks and the protesters in NYC…”\r\n“We have so much shit on you, your scandal would be bigger than Bill Cosby’s.”\r\nand finally.. “There’s an X rated tape of you, we bet you’d certainly don’t want public, are we right? @IGGYAZALEA….and this is nothing. Comply or else.”\r\nAwhile later, they posted “Now about that sex tape. We wont release the actual video. We have values to live by.”\r\n“However, we will release various snapshots of her face to confirm. The idea is not about releasing nudes. This shows nothing.”\r\n“The problem is why this tape even exists. It involves a man in a business suit, a kardashian-like attempt at fame, and a record label.”\r\nMTV then cast Anonymous in a misogynist light. Anonymous has now targeted MTV, saying “MESSAGE: @MTV your blatant false reporting and inability to reason along with swaying the public opinion has made us angry.”\r\n“MESSAGE: If not, @MTV, you will suffer a fate worse than @SonyPictures. \r\nYou have been warned. #OpMTVdown”\r\nFrom what I can tell, they still plan on releasing the X-Rated Tape. It is set to release about 10 hours from the time of this post.","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"5497bb756368726a81be0900","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@DiegoB\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5497bb0963687223049b0900#post_5497bb0963687223049b0900\r\nThe only is only in the middle of the Stardust crusaders arc anyway.
