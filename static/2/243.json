You know those times where you read a newspaper and remember the information, but you forget what newspaper you were reading?  I'm having one of those moments right now.  I remember they were talking about how researchers for years have thought that there might be others and that theoretically we could potentially create more.  Argh, I'm trying really hard to remember which science news was I reading again.  I'll get back to you when I remember. *edit  Crap, I just can not for the life of me seem to remember where I read this from.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"536c4fa96368725c980c0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"god i accidentaly read trans men instead of trans woman now im looking like an ass.","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"536c50096368725d502b0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@someguy111\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/536c439f6368725f7fdd0100#post_536c439f6368725f7fdd0100\r\n\r\nthats from kanye west album \"graduation\" he made a song about it, drawn by takashi murakami.\r\n\r\n!http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/70/Graduation_(album).jpg! \r\n\r\n","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"536c682b63687259fd170000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"And this is why I read Toriko.\r\n!http://d220.diamond.fastwebserver.de/series/Toriko/0276-015.png!\r\nA frog....with facial and sunglasses......riding on a go-kart.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"536c685b6368725be3600000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I just tried sardines for the first time.

Something like that would be able to do pretty much anything you could ever ask it to. You've got 16 cores/32 threads to play with and more RAM than most hard drives. Each FirePro GPU costs as much as a decent used car. Were this the early 2000's this single build could be it's own movie studio; I could make _Toy Story_ in a few days at the most, where it took months to make it back in the late 90's.\r\n\r\nThis isn't even what I would call high end. Try _8_ CPU's with 15 cores/30 threads each (the Xeon 8895v2) and a juicy 1.5TB of RAM; actually I would hold out for the new Xeon's which are supposed to have 18 cores/36 threads _each_. Could it run Crysis? Yes, 30 instances at once in fact if we give each one 4 cores, all of them at the highest quality level possible. This of course is provided that somehow each instance could have it's own dedicated GPU.","author":"5010fa077f123b1e4f00104e"},{"id":"536ce76163687257c4140300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"Dear residents of California\":http://www.cnet.com/news/california-senate-approves-smartphone-kill-switch-bill/","author":"5010fa077f123b1e4f00104e"},{"id":"536ced78636872539eba0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"After waking up this morning, \"Well time to see what's new in the world\" (reads the news) (all about monica lewinsky) . . . .
