This is like arguing whether the PS1 or the original Xbox is the best next gen console in 2014.\r\n\r\nThe reason why we don't synthesized food yet is costs due to mass manufacturing it would be too high(right now even if it were put into mass manufacturing it would cost twice as much).  In ten years it'll be cheap enough to kill off both gmo and naturally grown food as a whole industry wise.  In other words this argument is stupid in the long run because there won't be farms in ten years so both unmodified food and gmo will both be out of business; instead you're just going to be getting synthesized food instead.\r\n\r\n\r\nTen years from now\r\n!http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20090306201145/memoryalpha/en/images/a/a2/FoodSynthesizer.jpg!\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd before you give me that, \"They took muh job\" crap this would actually massively improve the economy and create millions of jobs, reduce farmland usage, reduce pollution, reduce our annual amount of oil used, increase health of individuals drastically due to being able to eat as much fast food as they want and still be eating healthy and potentially end world hunger.\r\n\r\nNow *BOTH* of you sit in the corner and think about what you've done before I bitchslap you both with science again.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"536876d263687205781d0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"Oarfish\":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xWaQ5E07yk","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"53687743636872121d210000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/536876bb63687246eed40100#post_536876bb63687246eed40100\r\nIf that really does happen I'm going to move out to remote area and grow and hunt/fish for my own food.

Nature has it figured out and out bodies are tuned to eat things that are from nature. Food without some bacteria or other pathogens on it may sound good at first but keep in mind, out bodies are designed for that kind of thing. If we eat perfectly sterile food, out bodies will lose their immunity to such pathogens and we could get sick very easily. As an outdoorsman, I can tell you that eating fresh caught fish from a clean lake cooked over an open campfire is far better than some farm raised junk with artificial coloring to make it look healthy.","author":"5010fa077f123b1e4f00104e"},{"id":"53687a626368724a837a0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Randomosaur\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5368783a63687226d2220000#post_5368783a63687226d2220000\r\nDo you mean those \"In vitro meats\":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_meat?","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"53687a6e6368725b11150000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Randomosaur\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/536878c2636872264a500000#post_536878c2636872264a500000\r\n\r\nI know im just being like retarded since its 1am but i cant sleep.","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"53687ac56368723326360100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@someguy111\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53687a5963687252db440000#post_53687a5963687252db440000\r\nThe good thing about artificially grown stem cell meat is at least you don't have kill or harm any animals in preparation of the food.","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"53687ac963687264e92a0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SeraphimDawn\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53687a626368724a837a0000#post_53687a626368724a837a0000\r\nNO!
