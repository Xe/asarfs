But if you're putting cameras in your HOME, that's just not right. It's where you LIVE. That's kinda the reason why I hate people publicizing their private lives, like talking about family issues and stuff (and call me a hypocrite for talking about this), because it's THEIR lives and shouldn't be the business of anyone else. Even within families, a brother's life and a sister's life, for example, should not overlap 100% with one another. That just raises issues.","author":"9ba2e84e636164642cc03200"},{"id":"54987ad76368721a5d8e0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54987a186368722f77da0300#post_54987a186368722f77da0300\r\nThe greatraccoon oozabob!","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"54987bc86368720a98ee0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"playing swimming pools drank while shooting aliens\r\n\r\ncan this game get better?","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"54987c606368725570aa0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I just realized\r\n\r\nI moved to a new house\r\n\r\nIn R/S/E/OR/AS the character moves to a new house\r\n\r\nI'm living a Pokemon game and I didn't even realize until just now\r\n\r\n[spoiler]There is a gym down the street from my house, I'ma go find a wild animal and use it to beat everyone up[/spoiler]","author":"9ba2e84e636164642cc03200"},{"id":"54987cb76368726b40090100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@EHAN\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54987c606368725570aa0200#post_54987c606368725570aa0200\r\nFind a Bear!
