What I mean by this is that even on the little scale synthesized food; I've seen people argue that synthesized food research should be banned because trying to end world hunger is \"evil\".  I've seen people argue that how we're only a couple years off of a cure for HIV that the research to cure HIV is \"evil\".  I've seen people argue that how 3d printing(imagine being able to house homeless for a fraction of the current price) may end homelessness is \"evil\" cause trying to end homelessness is \"evil\".  I've seen how computers are taking over controlling businesses financially is \"evil\" cause on the macro scale if/when all companies are controlled financially by computers that'll be the end of boom-bust cycles and therefore fixing bust cycles is \"evil\".\r\n\r\nWell they don't directly say that trying to make the world a better place is \"evil\" per say, but tend to beat around the bush and give a bullshit reason to justify their morality.  If someone says that children should starve to death to preserve their morals I highly doubt they're being logical.\r\n\r\n\r\nI don't know; I would rather be \"evil\" than \"good\" cause nowadays 95% of the time whenever someone says that something is evil they either mean \"doesn't fit my morality therefore it's evil\" or such.  I do believe there is such a thing as evil, but rather my personal definition of the source of evil is individuals who directly cause harm to others for the sake of proving one's self to be good.  Evil people don't just fucking pop out of thin air.  \"Evil\" is a learned personality trait; they don't just fucking pop out of thin air.  I know it's a Godwin, but Hitler didn't just pop out of fucking thin air with a army one day and invade Poland; he was once a child and grew into the adult history talks about; if he had a different family situation and was accepted into college then chances are WWII would have never happened cause he didn't just pop out of thin air like a deus ex machina.\r\n\r\n\r\nI don't know; I just think too many people think the world works like in comic books where the villain pops out of thin air one day materializing out of thin air and starts destroying the town.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54a57d4b6368724b81243500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a57c6463687202d13d2500#post_54a57c6463687202d13d2500\r\nYou okay there buddy?","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54a57db36368724c7cf71b00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a57d4b6368724b81243500#post_54a57d4b6368724b81243500\r\nYeah; just had to listen to some homophobes shit the other day and I wasn't allowed to say anything no matter what cause in his mind \"anyone who disagrees with me is automatically gay and anyone who is gay is evil and therefore they are evil for disagreeing with me\".","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54a57e0b63687202d1382600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a57db36368724c7cf71b00#post_54a57db36368724c7cf71b00\r\nAaaaaahhhh That'd do it.\r\nPersonally I believe that if someone wants to an uneducated bigoted shitstain then they can.

I totally agree that there is such a thing as evil, but most of the time \"evil\" is just a synonym for different.\r\n\r\nImagine what would happen to the world if the word \"evil\" just popped out of existence one second; imagine the face on all the homophobes, racists, sexists and xenophobes faces just *pop* the word \"evil\" is just instantly gone from their mind.
