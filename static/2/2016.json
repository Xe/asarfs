And here are my final thoughts.\r\n[spoiler]All in all I have to say that Bayonetta 2 is superior in just about every way. The combat was smoother and it was easier to have complete situational awareness. Bayo2's combat makes Bayo1 look rough by comparison. The enviroments and level designs were brighter and more interesting than in the first game. The enemies were more varied and mid-bosses actually felt like mid-bosses and not just beefed up normal enemies. The characters were all interesting and enjoyable. I never once wanted to punch Loki in the mouth and that is a very good thing. Balder too was a fascinating character and the  reveal of him being a cool guy is alright by me. The story......  well if you're playing Bayonettta for the story you need to reevalute your priorities. If I *had* to gripe about anything it would be the  lack of Angel Attack  and the Final Boss just felt kind of rushed to me. But I can honestly say that in this Squiggy's opinion, Bayonetta 2 beats Bayonetta 1 in ALMOST every way.[/spoiler]","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"5451d9a06368725b2cd70200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5451d8126368725c33e70000#post_5451d8126368725c33e70000\r\n[spoiler]the final boss is super unsatisfying if jubileus is still fresh in your mind. I dunno, it just felt like there could have been more. To be fair, I think the only way they could have topped jubileus is for a planetary scale fight between sheba and aesir.\r\n\r\nBut yeah, I honestly prefer it over the first game otherwise. Still need to play through bayo 1 a third time.
