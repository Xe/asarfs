Progenitory-progeny relationships' offspring's potential negative genetic side effects can be prevented by genetic testing embryos to see if the embryo has two of the same sets of dna; the chances of this is one in four; if the embryo doesn't then the chances of negative side effects is significantly lower.  If anyone here is in a progenitor-progeny relationship please be aware of the dangers of potential progeny without genetic testing the embryo first, but honestly I think that should be the default for any parent is that if they can afford genetic testing then they should be aware of any potentially negative traits beforehand.\r\n\r\nSCIENCE-HERO AWAY!\r\n*flies off using a jetpack*","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5477d22563687258392d0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5477d18b6368721cc6020100#post_5477d18b6368721cc6020100\r\nCan you believe I just realized that Constantine is part of the DC universe?","author":"5239db6da4c72d22d9000358"},{"id":"5477d24463687234a4ff0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Shadow the Hedgehog\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5477d22563687258392d0100#post_5477d22563687258392d0100\r\nDC actually.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"5477d27f6368723dc36d0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5477d18b6368721cc6020100#post_5477d18b6368721cc6020100\r\nThat reminds me, did you see Boku no hero academia yet by any chance?
