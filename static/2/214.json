Let's say you have 4 slots and each has an 8gig stick which is the highest amount desktop RAM will go and thus have 32 GB. Instead of having to buy a CPU with quad channel memory and a board with 8 slots, is there a way you can add more RAM? I heard about a RAM expander card that can be used via pci but those are from way back and I din't think would work with a modern board or CPU plus it's only DDR which means even with 4 slots it's only a 4gig increase. I don't want to buy server RAM because it's expense and of course needs a server CPU and board to use it.","author":"5010fa077f123b1e4f00104e"}]}
