The animal that comes in second place is a roundworm with only 302 neurons and this mouse's brain has 75 million neurons.  The human brain has around a 100 billion.  In only I believe 3 years(don't quote me on this) we've gone from mapping 302 neurons to 75,000,000 neurons.  Don't get too excited though, cause a human brain would be 98,000,000,000 gigabytes of information.  That's ~54,000 times the amount of information.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5366dfad6368722ab17e0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"So guys.
