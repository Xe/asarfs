Well the people of Ukraine have officially fucking had enough and are uniting to push the separatists out and the separatist's control is actually reversing.\r\n\r\nUkraine uses, \"GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!\"\r\nIt's super effective.\r\n\r\nYeah it's game over cause what is Russia or the separatists going to do?  Start mowing down tens of thousands of civilians?  Yeah I'm totally sure that won't have any huge ass repercussions(extreme sarcasm).

If Russia stops exporting or gets sanctioned all it would really mean is the cost of your gas going up by a couple cents/pence or whatever monetary system you use)\r\n\r\n\r\nEver since Crimea joined Russia their economy took a huge nosedive.  On the other hand if Ukraine joins the EU they would just need a short term loan that they've already raised most of the money for.  If eastern Ukraine joins Russia then their economy is going to go (cartoon whistle sfx of something falling) SPLAT!\r\n\r\nIt's probably why Ukraine's citizens are uniting together now; if they join Russia they're fucked financially; if they stay with Ukraine whether or not they agree with it then they're going to be okay financially in the end.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53759743636872494d880500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/537595036368724d41db0400#post_537595036368724d41db0400\r\n\r\nBecause this is something I thought about.
