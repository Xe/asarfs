Personally they should have stopped at Reach cause the main problems with Halo 4 is that it's starting to fall into what happened to the Call of Duty franchise in that the Call of Duty franchise was originally good, but rather than ending it when anyone with a brain would say to end it they milked it for all it's worth to the point that Activision is legitimately worried about their economic future cause they have no backup plan.\r\n\r\nMy money is on there will be halo 5 & 6, but after 6 there will be so few people playing it that 343 industries will be dead. . . and yes halo sales are considerably down and before you go, \"well they shipped <x> number of copies\" that doesn't mean they were all sold; halo 4 sales were considerably lower than halo 3 or reach and the total number of collective hours being played is considerably down also.\r\n\r\nTl:dr; Halo is that franchise that will continue to exist for the sake of milking it for all it's worth but the average consumer is forgetting about anyhow.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"548c8bb66368723f889c0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!https://31.media.tumblr.com/af83ab70668c6d34d931e651d0c97b3f/tumblr_ngiu1pOvgu1rckw3lo1_1280.jpg!","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"548c8bde636872456ed50100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"~^*ding.. dong.. dunnn. deoxys noises*^~","author":"511c09ec7f123b35980001eb"},{"id":"548c8c2b636872249bd50000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"You know, in a pinch I'm pretty sure I could take a wolf.\r\nMaybe two.
