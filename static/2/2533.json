Since I see how it works I'll use it against you.\r\n\r\nBUT if I have never seen something before and I never knew about it I cant Manifest and or copy it.\r\n\r\nIt also works where if I forget what something is and cant remember it I have to re copy it by looking at it again. and I only can Copy 3 things at a time and the more I copy the weaker one ability gets. \r\n\r\nShit my stand could copy shit like a meteor but its tiring.
