I fucking called it!\r\n\r\nIf you're wondering what I mean by \"I fucking called it!\" back when the Ukraine war was still a hot war was that Russia's economy is heavily reliant on exports and they are heavily reliant on the stock market.  Simply put they can't pull another cold war in Europe out of their ass without collapsing their economy because their economy collapsing is what caused the USSR to collapse so if they did try to start annexing parts of other countries in Europe their economy would collapse before they got anywhere.\r\n\r\nAnd this is one of the reasons why capitalism is a good thing on the international market; countries that have a stock market can't go rogue without threatening their entire country starving.\r\n\r\nMetaphorically speaking the cold war never ended, rather the means which lead for two global superpowers to enter and sustain a cold war are no longer around because when you get down to it the factors that led to the cold war are often contradictory to the factors that lead a country to economic prosperity.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5497cb246368722d4a420600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5497c96a636872243b030f00#post_5497c96a636872243b030f00\r\nHow come when US invaded Iraq, their economy doesn't go to the crappers?\r\n","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"5497ccf56368722304030c00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SeraphimDawn\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5497cb246368722d4a420600#post_5497cb246368722d4a420600\r\nBecause the US is a capitalist country and they aren't invading.","author":"505696b47f123b37e800effa"},{"id":"5497cd4763687208fbd70700","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@igotnopicks\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5497ccf56368722304030c00#post_5497ccf56368722304030c00\r\nHow was the Iraq War not an invasion?","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"5497cd6a6368723d28750500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://livedoor.blogimg.jp/nijimen/imgs/8/7/8702bf41-s.jpg!\r\n[spoiler]I'm going to bed in a minute.[/spoiler]","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"5497cda163687215c5d20700","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5497cd6a6368723d28750500#post_5497cd6a6368723d28750500\r\nI'll assume that's fried chicken.","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"5497cddc6368724881450b00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SeraphimDawn\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5497cb246368722d4a420600#post_5497cb246368722d4a420600\r\nCause the USA forms the backbone of the international economy and a lot of people practically worship the military.    Have you ever read 1984?  It's basically the hegemony in that two global super powers versus each other.\r\n\r\nCall me a masochistic asshole but I kind of want Russia's economic to collapse. . . Why?\r\n1)Putin would be given the blame and bye bye popularity.\r\n2)After the collapse of the USSR there was a massive drop in wars and war time fatalities because there was a massive drop in proxy wars.\r\n3)Without a large scale military country to oppose the war industry would collapse.\r\n\r\nCall me a asshole, but I want Russia's economy to collapse because then the USA's war industry would collapse which would cause again the sharp decline in wars after the collapse of the USSR and the USA's populace has been moving more and more towards isolationist policies rather interventionalism.\r\n\r\n\r\nTl:dr; I want Russia's economy to collapse because after the collapse of the USSR there was a 80% drop in wars so if it happened again the world would be a much more peaceful place.\r\n\r\n\r\nSide note: getting the USA to stop intervening is a tad more difficult cause Washington DC is full of a bunch of old farts who jizz every time they see a new f-35 being made.  Getting Washington to stop supporting interventialism is a tad more difficult because they practically worship war as their god; eventually in two years *when* Hillary gets elected(short explanation is that the only person that can stand up against here for the republicans is Jeb Bush but he has a snowball's chance in hell of getting past the primaries) there's going to be massive military budget cuts but that's not for another two years.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5497ce456368726911850800","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SeraphimDawn\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5497cd4763687208fbd70700#post_5497cd4763687208fbd70700\r\nIt's not a war.\r\n\r\nThe Congress has the right to declare war.
