What is being looked at medically basically what it would be is a air filter for your blood.  The way the nanoparticle works is that if you inject it into a person's blood stream only viruses would get trapped inside the structure thus making them inert.  It doesn't fight viruses so much as filters them out.  If someone has say HIV or such you could inject the person with the nanoparticles and every time a cellwall from T-cells is broken down releasing new viruses instead of infecting new cells the viruses would just get trapped like a rat in a cage instead.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5369381663687267a5b00000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"So today my boyfriend told me that he gets random boners in English Literature class, and that's the reason why he wears thick pants.

The reason being is that most of the time when codes for secret information are created the cipher to deceiver them is extremely predictable in that most of the time the way the information is transmitted is done lazily and half-assed.\r\n\r\nA more effective way of communicating information is to have set 1, 2, 3 of dictionaries.  What I mean by that is for set 1 you have all set list of words to use in all 3 sets and for set 1 each word is randomly assigned a random number out of one million, set 2 does the same but with different random numbers for each word, set 3 does the same but with different random numbers.  Then what you do is take those three sets and prescribe randomly assigned numbers for sets of three words.  In other words a set of three words such as \"the target left\" could be assigned a random number anywhere from 0 to 10^24.  To crack just three words out of a sentence would take 115 days.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"536976b363687248781d0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"So guys, brussels sprouts.\r\nTruly they are the greatest of the green vegetables.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"536976fd636872562ae50000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53697628636872566dab0000#post_53697628636872566dab0000\r\n\r\ni still dont know why they posted that aqua teen hunger force, and why nobody has downloaded it.\r\n\r\nwhy not dr weird.\r\n\r\ngentlemen, behold, i have created a secret message transmitter.\r\n\r\nbut its on youtube, then woulnt it stop being a secret?\r\n\r\nshut up steve or ill call the corn again","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"53697a1b63687215b4360100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@twistedmetalero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/536976fd636872562ae50000#post_536976fd636872562ae50000\r\nThat show made fun of Furries.","author":"50884a9b7f123b4053000d18"}]}
