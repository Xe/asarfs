I actually wondered what happens if Sunset Shimmer was actually sent to the Stargate Universe? I mean the premise would be that they had access to a quantum mirror which was one way, Sunset had her memories suppressed in order to stop her from doing harm to anyone when she got there.\r\n\r\nAnd so the SGC takes her in for the time being and then has her shipped off to high school under foster care, with Jonathan O'Neill, you know Jack's clone from season 7 I believe. It'd make an interesting story, also if Jonathan was involved with the SGC still as a external operator for them.
