We could live on it in underground shelters, but the radiation would slowly kill everything.  100 years of terraforming for there to be enough of a atmosphere for you to be able to walk around without a space suit and just need a respirator, 400 years of terraforming until you could breath on mars.\r\n\r\nHowever any and all live on mars would need to massively genetically altered to withstand high radiation.  If I'm not mistaken pot can survive that level of radiation.  You wouldn't have to worry about not having enough colonists.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5376e6c163687238228f0400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@gasmaskangel\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5376e0da6368725283d10100#post_5376e0da6368725283d10100\r\n\r\n\"@twistedmetalero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5376de6f6368723b90bc0100#post_5376de6f6368723b90bc0100\r\n\r\nMy first act once I conquer the world has been revealed to me ","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"5376e72d63687229d0130500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@QuasarNova\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5376e6c163687238228f0400#post_5376e6c163687238228f0400\r\nYour reign will be short-lived.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"5376e7b563687225b60c0600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5376e72d63687229d0130500#post_5376e72d63687229d0130500\r\n\r\nNo, because I will kill anyone I contacted  in the site to avoid future insurrections.
