Kuuga and Agito are highly recommended to those who can handle slower paces. I loved Ryuki enough that I could stomach Nihon subs. (Which as I've said quite a few times before, Are terribad) 555 through Decade are not recommended. (They're not good enough to be worth going through Nihon subs IMO, And the ones I would recommend have worse Nihon subs than usual.) I don't think I've seen a single person who hates W and OOO, So I'd say check those out, Wizard is apparently really boring, And Gaim is written by Urobuchi. (Nuf said) Also, I have nothing to say about Drive because I know nothing about it.\r\n\r\nBefore the Reboot, I recommend ZO & J. (They condense the showa rider formula into about 40-50 minutes) Also, I loved Black. (Though It's very formulaic)","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"545dc62363687241ebeb0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/545dbcd36368725b7efd0100#post_545dbcd36368725b7efd0100\r\n\"Anti-magic\"\r\n\r\nAAAAAH","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"545dc65b6368720af69a0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Hi, I'm back.
