Well to preface it for one Japanese culture massively looks down upon otakus and geek culture and there's a massive cultural generational gap going on.  What's interesting is that a study of 5k college students in Japan 40% of them classify themselves as otakus.\r\n\r\nBasically geeks are taking over Japan, but Japanese culture doesn't like that very much cause Japanese culture shuns geeks.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54a38bf06368725aadbd2400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a38b3063687202ff390600#post_54a38b3063687202ff390600\r\nIsn't Japanese culture also extremely conservative?

So does Chinese culture due to years of Japanophobia.\r\nBut a tremendous amount of the young ones are anime and video game fans, particularly from Hong Kong.\r\n\r\nMany Taiwanese openly embrace Japanese, and otaku culture.\r\n\r\nKoreans on the otherhand... I hear they're traditionally quite Japanophobic. But, they produce many great anime and anime-style works(Manga, games, shows etc) and pride themselves with them.","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"54a38dcc63687219bf260100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@gasmaskangel\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a38bf06368725aadbd2400#post_54a38bf06368725aadbd2400\r\nYou just summarized like 50% of the cultural news from Japan in a single sentence.\r\n\r\nPeople under 30 are massively liberal whereas people over 30 are conservative.  For example 70% of people under thirty in Japan support same-sex marriage where as 70% of those over 60 years old are opposed.  Japan is slowly becoming socially liberal, but they're not going down without a fight first.\r\n\r\nPersonally I think same-sex marriage will be legalized there in 5-10 years, but I'm just illustrating a point.\r\n\r\nThe older generations are massively socially conservative whereas the younger ones are becoming ever increasingly socially liberal.  Eventually in a decade or so Japan is going to become socially liberal; it's just their older generations fucked up their economy, fucked up the country, fucked up their future and are now blaming otakus and such for their fuck ups rather than admit they ran their country into the ground.\r\n\r\nJapan's mass media won't ever admit it but they also have a massive race problem.\r\n\r\nTl:dr of my point; the older generations in Japan are xenophobic homophobic racists who ran their country into the ground both socially and economically and now that they're losing control of their society rather than admit they fucked up the country they're blaming the younger generations.\r\n\r\nSide note: before someone goes \"nuh-uh\" about the race thing it's mainly the older generations and such and considering history can you really expect those generations that grew up in a extremist nationalist culture to just dump it all of a sudden?","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54a38ec86368720bde371a00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I find it strange that Japan apparently isn't Geeky.
