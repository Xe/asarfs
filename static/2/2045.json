My problem with twisty and other homestuck fans is they smear thousands of images all over going, \"be a fan already\" and expect you to become a fan just by posting random images.  If I knew why people like homestuck then I would check it out.\r\n\r\n1)What is homestuck about?\r\n2)Why do you like it?\r\nThat's *ALL* I'm asking; I just want to know why people like homestuck cause if it sounds interesting I may check it out.  I wish twisty would stop shitting up the thread and actually explain why he likes homestuck.  If homestuck sounds interesting I will actually give it a chance.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5455be2a6368726e93360000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5455bd6663687260909b0100#post_5455bd6663687260909b0100\r\nTwo sides of the same coin.\r\nLove is about knowing as much as you can about a person. Love is being in the same room and not needing a single word between you. It's about liking someone strengths and accepting their weakness. Love is confusing, chaotic, and a lot of time it doesn't make sense.
