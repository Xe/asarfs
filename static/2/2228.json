When dealing with infants, if it's their first night in a new location and they happen to wake up, they are going to freak out. This is an inevitability. There are unfamiliar with where they are and are, very understandablly, SCARED. Do not, and I repeat, DO NOT start yelling, screaming, or trying to force them asleep. It will only make the situation worse. The best thing to do is pick them up, hold them tightly to your chest, and just walk. While rubbing their back and gently talking to them. It helps relax them and ease them back to sleep.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"5469b4fe6368723da8140000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5469b3be6368725352390300#post_5469b3be6368725352390300\r\nAHHH\r\nthey are just wee little babbehs\r\nHopefully you'll get some sleep before sunrise \r\n\r\nYes, infants tend to relax after hearing a heartbeat.
