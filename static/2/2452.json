It's that one thing you have such a trouble finding balance in, I tried being non conformist, but my family kept trying to make me conform because I didn't really dress or act the way they wanted me to. Though that part about dressing isn't really my fault. \r\n\r\nThere's a fine line to follow, I act courteous but not disrespectful to others, and I don't show respect to people who haven't either earned it or deserve it. Which has put me at odds with people in the past, and family too.

I have problems with that too.\r\n\r\nIt's the first were the main issue lies.
