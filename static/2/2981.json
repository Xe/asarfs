Also, you have to admit that the quality of the comics have been deteriorating lately. It's a disturbing trend. I like to believe they may come back good again, but from the looks of things right now, it doesn't give much optimism. But for the show on the other hand, since how well season 4 finale and RR performed, I have much hope (cautiously). I guess people are especially mad at the comic because of the long hiatus, more people pay attention to the comics right now. Once season 5 starts, people might not give the comics this much attention.","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"54a624596368721cde871f00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Twisty\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a624076368727e4a252600#post_54a624076368727e4a252600\r\nBonnie mugshot\r\n!http://41.media.tumblr.com/81c9ed25ad35bb26a118103ce379afc9/tumblr_new9mlCVaC1sl9lr9o9_250.png!","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"54a6254d6368720535540600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SeraphimDawn\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a624386368724ea5310d00#post_54a624386368724ea5310d00\r\nQuick question; how is the show doing?

Except the Spike Microseries and the Gazebo arc.\r\n\r\nI haven't read much past the Nightmarity arc. Just a few friends forevers and they didn't seem that bad. But yeah. I think the comics will bounce back. I;ve seen it before in other comics with lots of writers. Period of shiete, then it gets okay or good for a period, rinse repeat.
