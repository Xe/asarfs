(Usually I go 3 or 4 times a year)\r\n\r\nSo, I'm going to watch the ASEAN University Games here live and it will be great. I watched the last year's games at Laos and my favourite event would be swimming.\r\nSo, if any of you guys were to watch sports like these live, which event would you cheer on?","author":"4fe1b9f47f123b13df002976"},{"id":"5493a218636872788cdc0500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120927051549/spongebob/images/2/25/Day_three.jpg!\r\nToday was pretty nice and easy, not a lot of heavy furniture to carry, and not a lot to carry in general.\r\n\r\nExam today was actually really easy, but jeez was it long. I had to use the entire 90 minutes given because it was 150 questions. All generally easy questions, but it all adds up in the end. Add the fact that we didn't get in until 15 minutes after we were supposed to start due to some dumb planning issues with the administration, and yeah, it was kinda hectic.\r\n\r\nTomorrow I've got two more exams: my math and my english. The first should be a breeze for me, but I might struggle a bit with english. Nothing I'm too worried over though, I feel confident enough that I can complete them without much trouble.\r\n!http://i.imgur.com/gOyWhrn.png!\r\n!http://i.imgur.com/7GLzYOO.gif!\r\n[spoiler]Exactly why I don't bother studying, this will happen both if I do study and if I don't study, so I figure, why bother wasting time with something I'm not interested in doing[/spoiler]\r\n\r\nAfter that, I'm finally free for almost three full weeks.
