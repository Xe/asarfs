I was reading something about the fear about hiveminds in science fiction and the person actually made a really good point about why it's not so irrational actually.\r\n\r\nYou know how a lot of people simply live to work, live to get money, live to get the latest fastest car and such?  Well what's going to happen in thirty to forty years when the individual would only need to work for a couple hours a week to sustain themselves?  Basically imagine it's 2050; there's now cybernetic technology to the point that people can recycle their bodily waste and rather than actually needing to go anywhere they can just go into a simulation for stimulation rather than actually traveling anywhere.\r\n\r\nBasically what the person is worried about is imagine a future where 90% of the population lives in microapartments and spends all their time in simulations and only works 1-2 hours a week to the point that consciously they're dead; if you were to unplug them completely they would slump into their chair, accidentally shit themselves cause they don't remember how to control their bodily functions, wouldn't talk and would just stare at the wall.   Not necessarily a hivemind but rather over-dependence to the point that they literally can't function or think without being dependent on a computer thinking for them.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"545ecf5b63687221a8c70100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/545ecd80636872779f3b0000#post_545ecd80636872779f3b0000\r\nPersonally, I find that one a bit far fetched. At least in it's entirety.\r\n\r\nI can see people getting more socially isolated, I mean, we already are. But there is starting to be a look at why and push against it. Not big, but something.\r\n\r\nOn the hivemind thing, I'd be more worried about the guy who literally managed to make a very, very low level telepathic communication than I would the possibility of people becoming even more socially isolated. Especially if it gets into mind reading territory.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-29093700\r\n\r\nHere's the article if you don't believe me.\r\n\r\n","author":"500757fd7f123b75a90003b1"},{"id":"545ed10b636872366ea30200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/545ecd80636872779f3b0000#post_545ecd80636872779f3b0000\r\nImagine if we can upload the conscience of a dying person and immortalize him/her inside the virtual reality system, like they're in a permanent dream when their bodies are long rotted away.\r\n\r\nAs much as I admire virtual reality and dream world themes.
