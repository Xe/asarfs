Since Ranma fell into one of those ponds, he was cursed and transformed into a girl. What bothered me was why female Ranma had red hair while male Ranma had black one. So based on how the pond works, I theorized that Ranma isn't transformed into a female version of himself but instead transformed into the specific girl that fell into the pond hundreds or thousands of years ago and probably drowned. This explains why female Ranma had a different hair colour.\r\n\r\nIn short, Ranma is *not* cursed to be a girl. He is cursed to be *the* girl that drowned in the pond many years ago.\r\n\r\nEvery time we see Ranma's female form, we see nothing but a girl who died drowning.\r\n\r\n!http://clouddreamer.com/ranma.gif!","author":"4fe1b9f47f123b13df002976"},{"id":"54a11e616368726a6ca80300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Princess♠Molestia\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a11caf63687217e75c0600#post_54a11caf63687217e75c0600\r\n!http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/734/901/b82.jpg!\r\n(one on the right is daredevil)\r\n\"@HJSDGCE\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a11e5663687221b2940d00#post_54a11e5663687221b2940d00\r\nI thought this was pretty well known already.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54a11edd636872455ac10200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"FAR CRY 4 BLOOD DRAGON 2 WHEN?\r\n\r\nALSO I HOPE ITS FILLED WITH 90´S REFERENCES ","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"54a11f4c6368724cfe9c0c00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a11e616368726a6ca80300#post_54a11e616368726a6ca80300\r\nNope.
