to post this story from the videogame COH here cause gasmask made me remember it\r\n\r\nit was a 4 X 4 match in company of heroes.\r\nmy side consised of 2 panzer elite , i was a wehrmatch with my friend (who started the game), the enemies consisted of 3 dirty yanks and 1 brit.\r\nbasically my friend was leading us all, so our first move was slowly but surely take the points with highest gasoline (which were on the sides)\r\nafter we got there our forces split in 2 sides, the allies took the pain control point so they had an advantage point also considering it had lots of barricades and places to fend off it was like a fortress, meanwhile we strugled to keep our points, our pioneers built sandbags, barbed wires and bunkers like crazy, MG´s, motorcycles, we had armadas defending those little points, i was on the right side, and i was basically bleeding out every manpower i had to help my comrades.\r\nfinally the allies gave up, and retreated to their little fortress, this is where they started their mistake, with all the fuel we got and all the xp we got from kills i sended some camo snipers to that point, and thats when all of us unleashed misiles, hellfires, mortars, everything, the place felt like stalingrad in miniature.\r\nfirst hour\r\nfinally they were too weak and we rolled them out, this is where things got ugly.\r\nboth sides started rolling out tanks, left and right armored cars, artillery, bazookas, commandos in airplanes, everyone wanted that point.\r\n2 hour.\r\nafter this we fought to the point we finally drove them back, this is where our warmachine got real, tiger tanks, panther tank squads, king tigers, this is where it became a front and back fight, both sides sending their tanks one after another, since the americans and brits are incredibly resourcefull, it didint matter how many tanks we destroyed of them (1 of our tanks could take out about 5 of theirs) they will just spawn more using war machine abilities to the point they made us retreat, and we had to do it again, it really was just hell,\r\n2 hours\r\nafter this everything was shit, every little place was in flames, or black, or filled by craters and tank leftovers, we kept and kept sending and they kept and kept creating.\r\nuntil the british player left…\r\nthe british are known to work will with amis cause they have mobile bases, which allows anyone to create more soldiers, and have better repair engineers, since the AI in the game was put on normal (none of us expected to leave) the brit started making dumb moves, and this allowed us to destroy their mobile bases and pretty much drive them back to their bases.\r\nlast hour.\r\nafter this we slowly but surely made them weaker, they were desperate, they had all engineers building mines and sandbags, tank traps, and creating soldiers and soldiers and tanks too, meanwhile we foiled every last defense with a fast and strong opposition, big tanks like tigers, panthers, king tigers, stugs (which had artillery rounds) and thousands of soldiers equipped with assault rifles, bazookas, snipers killing everyone trying to advance, pioneers building upgraded bunkers that allowed us to easily reinforce our troops and repair tanks.\r\nthey were trapped.\r\nat this point we gathered all the fuel we could and then we put our last plan.\r\nsended 1 sniper and we launched all of our misilles, hellfires that burned everything, hitler´s secret missiles that scorched every vehicle in the area and rains of small misiles that took every last soldier.\r\nwe rolled everything we had and we found little to no resistance from their leftover squads of engineers and soldiers, some 50 cal machineguns here and there, and some damaged and alost about to die shermans, tank destroyers, the leftover calliopes which were too close to fire, and 1 m26 pershing, which was their lasr hope, (but since we had a king tiger that last hope didint last long)\r\nand thats how germany won WW2.\r\nand then we all proceded to throw missiles at each other effectibly destroying our own bases as celebration[/bq]\r\n\r\ni wont let this sweet story die by leaving it in the other
