If someone has problems with geeks they're allowed to have their opinions, but gas attacks are crossing the line.\r\n\r\nObviously the gas attack doesn't have anything to do with gamergate, but the anti-geek movement has gone way to far when they're willing to gas people.  If someone doesn't like geeks that's all fine and good, but gassing people is not morally acceptable or legal.  The people at furfest were lucky the person responsible was a dumbass and didn't know chemical warfare, cause otherwise that would have ended really badly.  Those 19 people that were hospitalized are lucky to be alive.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54854fe26368722d93340100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Princess♠Molestia\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54854de06368722b83f00000#post_54854de06368722b83f00000\r\nBut you don't agree with how the SJWs do things.

Obviously this doesn't have to do with gamergate, *BUT* the anti-geek movement is quickly becoming a actual terrorist movement.  I would not be surprised at all if the anti-geek movement in five years is just a front for a terrorist organization.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"548552216368722af2700100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!https://38.media.tumblr.com/67d912ab881599bd3265952527f58c6a/tumblr_ng8ykquqbz1t6owjvo1_1280.png!","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"5485528d6368722a07830100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/875/653/f4b.jpg!","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"548552b463687217e3260000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/548552216368722af2700100#post_548552216368722af2700100\r\n*PFAHAHAHAHAHA!*","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"548552c5636872274ed30100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Twisty\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5485528d6368722a07830100#post_5485528d6368722a07830100\r\nto quote Stay Alive\r\nagain\r\n\"If you die in the game, you die for real.\"","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"548552f56368722a90c20100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/548551a36368722760920100#post_548551a36368722760920100\r\nI know some SJWs have been involved in these cyber-attacks.

BUUUUUT. They have the worst ways of saying things, tend to act like bigots themselves, and ussually are just rude as hell. So no. Do not care for them.\r\n\r\nI just have issue with the gaming community cause they bicker alot and seem to be rude to each other so much. Over games. I don't think I  want to be a part of that. \r\n\r\nDon't take that to mean I'd be an ass to someone cause they are a gamer either. That would be just rude and being a horrible human being.\r\n\r\nNor do I place the gaming community at the levels of SJW. At most the gaming community irritates me, but it's their thing. They're doing what they want, Doing and talking about what they love, what ignites their passions. I may not like the arguing that goes on, but it is ultimately harmless.\r\n\r\nSJW...seem to tend to spread hate.\r\n\r\nBig difference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54854f936368722716dc0000#post_54854f936368722716dc0000\r\nYeah I heard about that.
