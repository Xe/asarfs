Most people have probably seen it by now, but the morals of the show are extremely pertinent to the usa since when you break it down the morals are, \"the war on drugs isn't working\", \"pay teachers more\" and \"give americans better health care\".\r\n\r\nHealth care in the usa is outright fucking terrible.  When I got hit by a truck you know what was the first thing they asked me when I go into the hospital, \"What's your insurance provider?\"  It wasn't, \"Any broken bones?\" or \"Do you feel light headed like you're about to pass out?\"  It was straight up asking me for insurance before they even made sure I wasn't internally bleeding out or anything.  The second they took me off the stretcher they asked that too.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"536063ad636872520a290000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@MoogSourceVermona\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/536061d563687214f2670000#post_536061d563687214f2670000\r\nYes. Yes it is, although I'm not sure I'd call Walter White old.

That's the sort of shit that I can't fix and if I got something like that I would have to resort to nuking it from orbit.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"536067ab6368723725390000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5360671e63687221c4850000#post_5360671e63687221c4850000\r\n\r\nCan it do without formatting?","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"536068e86368726b9d030000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@twistedmetalero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/536067ab6368723725390000#post_536067ab6368723725390000\r\nIt's probably hiding on unused space on your hard drive.  Run bleachbit twice(the free disk space option overwrites unused hard drive space) and go through your installed programs looking for something fishy.  What I mean by that is in control panel in the list of installed programs if something says something like, \"browser software you don't recognize\" find out where it's installed and delete it.  If you don't know what it is then don't touch it.\r\n\r\nIf that doesn't work I don't know what to do, cause that means it's one of those actually severe viruses.  The only advice I have at that point is formatting, run bleachbit and then put your stuff back on.\r\n\r\nIf it's a virus I wouldn't worry too much about accidentally putting it on a external hard drive cause _normally_ they don't hide out in your picture or such, but I still would run a virus scan on your external hard drive just to be sure.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53606928636872704c100000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/536068e86368726b9d030000#post_536068e86368726b9d030000\r\n\r\nBut its just fresh out of a format\r\n\r\nIll just run bleach since i dont know how to format\r\nGod this shit is giving me a headache","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"53606af6636872573e300100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/536068e86368726b9d030000#post_536068e86368726b9d030000\r\n\r\nSo i got bleach bit, do i just send it to scan everything for the night?","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"53606af66368727b6a770000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@twistedmetalero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53606928636872704c100000#post_53606928636872704c100000\r\nWell run bleachbit first, check your installed programs for any program you don't recognized, if you don't know what it does leave it alone, delete it and that should be it.

Also do NOT interrupt it, leave your computer on.
