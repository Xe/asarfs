My morals and beliefs are superiors to yours cause I know more than you know and I know everything in the world because you don't know everything, but I know everything\", \"NO!  My morals and beliefs are far greater than anything you can imagine because I have become enlightened!\"  You can't really blame anyone for this though, because the realization that every individual person only ever knows a small fraction of all the knowledge collected scares a lot of people when they realize it.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54a3370f63687272d0000a00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Twisty\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a336c463687259f1000100#post_54a336c463687259f1000100\r\nIs that the guy you posted being nailed by a topless white guy with a bin?","author":"515ddf93a4c72d8a1f000d57"},{"id":"54a3373b6368723c7c770300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@ParagonCommander\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a3370f63687272d0000a00#post_54a3370f63687272d0000a00\r\n\r\nyes","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"54a3374663687272d00c0a00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Carcass Strife\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a336476368725d4d520c00#post_54a336476368725d4d520c00\r\nWho's Dexter?","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54a337976368722a7a950000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a33619636872791aef2300#post_54a33619636872791aef2300\r\nBeen there.\r\n\r\n\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a336f36368723c7c1f0300#post_54a336f36368723c7c1f0300\r\nPersonally I find that knowledge comforting.
