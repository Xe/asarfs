It either that or she likes Mochas, I know I do, or maybe something finer, I can't think of a better kind of coffee. \r\n\r\nPinkie Pie would probably drink every single common soft drink in existence, though I doubt she'd like Vanilla Cola, then again I dislike it since the taste was weird for me. It's not for everyone I have to say. I'm not sure what else she'd drink. \r\n\r\nApplejack is definitely mostly an apple biased drinker, so no big expectations she'd drink that much besides apple juice, cider and applesauce, who needs water right? They're not caveponies, Props to whoever gets that slightly obscure reference. \r\n\r\nRainbow Dash would be definitely a hard drinker, mostly water, alcohol when she gets the chance and lastly sports drinks in the form of refined rainbow liquids. She gets her morning kicks from that. \r\n\r\nFluttershy I almost forgot, I am unsure of what she drinks, I mean she drinks with Rarity so she could like coffee or tea, or any number of drinks. I seriously doubts she drinks any form of alcohol since she really doesn't seem like a drinker. So I'm at a loss here. \r\n\r\nNow onto Royalty. \r\n\r\nCelestia likes or hates tea, I can't be sure since I keep imagining her other version from that comic, you know which one I mean. \r\nBut established Celestia, who constantly drinks tea, well I do see her as a white wine drinker, or maybe something more indulgent, I'm not sure what the best kind of spirits are since I don't think that often. \r\n\r\nLuna I can take is sort of like Celestia, though not as conservative in terms of tastes, I can imagine her downing a few cups of mead and larder when she gets the chance. \r\n","author":"5046d66d7f123b38980018c6"},{"id":"54a768d36368720397420700","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Evident Disaster\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a7688e6368727e37861100#post_54a7688e6368727e37861100\r\nCelestia likes SunnyD?","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"54a768d8636872779f670400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Number1pegasus\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a7670f6368720530890800#post_54a7670f6368720530890800\r\nThis show is fucking great!","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54a7690063687275b15b0900","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Evident Disaster\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a7688e6368727e37861100#post_54a7688e6368727e37861100\r\nI bet Luna loves beer.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54a769ca6368722e378b0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a768d8636872779f670400#post_54a768d8636872779f670400\r\nIt fucking is!
