That's what you wanted, right? Well, I've decided I don't like people like you. You've messed with the board of the wrong doubles guy. Before you get excited, you haven't even made me check em. I am a hard person to make check em. However, I despise people like you.\r\n\r\nYour pitiful get skills are hilarious. Getting dubs and checking em are level 1. Can you get trips? Can you get countdown? Your silly little doubles don't impress me. I've gotten quads and even stolen major gets from other boards. I've gotten dubs on \"the cancer that'll save 4chan.swf\". I have been getting since I had a computer. It's what I was raised to do.\r\nYou have no idea to the extent of fear which you should be feeling. All you are is just a /b/tard trying to fit in. Have you ever worn a rain coat? I have no life and I will probably post on [s4s] all day.\r\n\r\nYou think I'm giving you an empty threat? Believe that. I have copies of the style section all over the place. If you have a \r\nreservation at Dorsia you better check em.\r\n\r\nPost randomly if you want to, but I am smart enough to time my posts. Check mine if you want, but it'll just make it easier for me to get more.\r\n\r\nWith dubs,\r\n\r\nThe Doubles Guy\r\n\r\nP.S. I would listen to \"Hip to be Square\" while you're checking.\r\n\r\nP.S4S. check em\r\n","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"54a3c20763687266691f0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Albus Fahrenheits\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a3c105636872040dfe0400#post_54a3c105636872040dfe0400\r\nSonata: we're gonna blow it uP!

That's what you wanted, right? Well, I've decided I don't like mortals like you. You've messed with the Oblivion realm of the wrong dremora. Before you get excited, you haven't even made me angry. I am a hard Valkynaz to make angry. However, I despise mortals like you.\r\nYour pitiful gate-closing skills are hilarious. Going through oblivion gates and stealing sigil stones are level 1. Can you summon a Xivilai to do your will? Can you put out the dragonfires that separate Tamriel from Oblivion without leaving a trace? Do you even lift, bro? Your silly little iron shield won't protect you. I've summoned so many daedra and captured their souls. I've done the bidding of Mehrunes Dagon himself. I've been serving him since I was a simple Churl. It's what I was derived from the formless ether to do.\r\nYou have no idea to the extent of fear you should be feeling. All you are is just a community of mortals. Have you ever dipped an entire village in lava? I have no empathy and I will probably feel joy peeling your skin off your face.\r\nYou think I'm giving you an empty threat? Believe that. I have daedra in dark places that you don't want to know about. If you live even close to an oblivion gate you better fear for your life.\r\nDivine my location if you want to, but I am cunning enough to do this from Oblivion. Come through my gate if you want, but it'll just make it easier for me to track you.\r\nWith pure, mindless, unrelenting hatred,\r\nA Dremora Valkynaz\r\nP.S I would fear for your life while you still have it","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"54a3c49063687265e7600800","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Twisty\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a3c4326368721cdb8c0800#post_54a3c4326368721cdb8c0800\r\nShut up Daedra, go back to your plane of existence...
