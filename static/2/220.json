You want to hear the story of how scientology became so mainstream?

There will never be a WWIII or large scale nuclear war due to economic reasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n[spoiler]I know I keep going on about Ukraine, *BUT* the number crunching came down and simply put Russia can not afford a actual war with Ukraine.  Russia's GDP annually is only 2.5 trillion and exports count for 500 billion of that annually with their primary export being oil.  If they do go to war in Ukraine then there's going to be tens of millions of Russians starving to death in the streets.  If Russia ever does actually do something severe enough to piss off the international community they'll have starved to death far earlier than the situation could possibly get bad enough for a nuclear war to happen.  When you get right down to it there's a high probability they're bluffing on Ukraine to either get as much of Ukraine as they can get before the hammer comes down or they're trying to gamble without people calling their bluff to come out on top with as much money as they can when the situation does eventually get resolved.  To put it simply:  They're bluffing.  The problem is that the EU and Obama aren't gamblers and won't call the bluff until they know for 100% certain it's a bluff.  Oh and before you worry about China, they're too tied into the world economy also.\r\n\r\nIn other words there will never be a nuclear WWIII cause the countries with large arsenals are too dependent on the world's economy.  If there ever is a nuclear war it will be a small scale war of say Pakistan vs India.\r\n\r\nTl:dr; You can relax a bit about Ukraine cause this situation isn't going to go anywhere due to economic reasons.[/spoiler]","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53684a20636872077b6b0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Gah!

Who is vicarious and what exactly do they do?  That's a bit longer to explain. . . Where do I start. . I know from the start.  We all know that humans when it comes to money and managing money are imperfect no matter how intelligent or rational the person is.  A company when you get right down to it is potentially millions of imperfect individuals all trying to control every single aspect of a company to make sure they stay afloat, but over time in the world's economy all the little dumb mistakes start to pile up and up until the gravity of the situation causes what we would call a recession or depression.  A prime example of this was the housing crash, millions of smart people making the occasional dumb decisions that piled up till it could no longer be sustained then one day came crumbling down in a chain reaction.\r\n\r\nThat's where vicarious comes in; the premise is what if you removed imperfect humans from the financial making decision process of a company?  Imagine a world without bankers.  Bankers may be specialists who go to college for years and have decades of experience, but at the end of the day banking is essentially number crunching; they're extremely easily replaceable when you get right down to it.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"536865b9636872541e330000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Randomosaur\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5368640163687225d75f0000#post_5368640163687225d75f0000\r\nMonsanto does get up to some shady shit, but on the other hand organic food in general is pretty much a giant scam.","author":"4f41ee04945b701c41002af7"},{"id":"536867166368720a4d080000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@gasmaskangel\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/536865b9636872541e330000#post_536865b9636872541e330000\r\nThis whole debate is probably going to die out in a couple years when we're all eating printed food. . .

Think about it like this: this is how food is supposed to be. 300 years ago, for example, they did not grow food in synthetic fertilizers or spray them down with poisonous pesticides or herbicides. Organic is how food is _supposed_ to be: natural, and the human body recognizes that. If you go out in the middle of nowhere in nature and find a bush with some berries take note that they have not been sprayed with poison, grown in poison, or blasted with radiation to preserve shelf life. This is actual food, not some artificial Frankenstein abomination created for the sake of profits for a publicity traded company.","author":"5010fa077f123b1e4f00104e"}]}
