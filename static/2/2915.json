But I meant more in terms of the market supplying it. More adult cartoons are supplied in Japan, so economically it is not seen as a lost cause I suppose so there you go.\r\n\r\nIronically though, tangent... According to the guy innthe video I linked in SJW thread anime cons have an sjw issue and that may hold back it developing here since it would be appropriation (despite early anime being influenced by Disney).[/bq]\r\nHonestly I think the cultural problems in Japan are pretty serious cause rather than address the economic and cultural problems they just keep blaming otakus rather than fix the fucking problem.\r\n\r\n\"Otakus are destroying our economy\"\r\n\"No no; that doesn't have anything to do with the economy; fix your fucking economy instead of blaming otakus\"\r\n\"But I want to spend all my time blaming them instead of putting actual effort into fixing the actual economic problems\"\r\n\r\nStrangely enough personally I think Japan in ten/twenty years is going to become a otaku nation like south korea because the older generations are driving the country off a cliff, constantly blaming the younger generations and complaining about the younger generations how they're a bunch of otakus.  In ten/twenty years you're going to have a nation primarily controlled by a group of people who have been looked down all their life, who have been constantly blamed for everything that their parents did and who have been handed a country in severe stagnation while getting constantly insulted.  That's going to be a massive paradigm shift to go from one extreme to the exact opposite extreme in only a decade or two.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyways, getting back on track:\r\nAnime in japan is the equivalent of live action for children here financially.  What I mean by this is that imagine if instead of the vast majority of cartoon network, nick and such being filled with live action shows or such they actually showed only cartoons.\r\n\r\nThe sjw theory is actually a good theory, cause with who sjw are close to that might business wise pressure companies to not try to bring anime to the west.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54a21f69636872688a530200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a21f176368725d4ca50100#post_54a21f176368725d4ca50100\r\nOh, I didn't know that you already started it.\r\n\r\n[spoiler]Dinozaur is an Amazing first monster.[/spoiler]","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"54a21f906368722ce2370200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I fap to nothing\r\n!!http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/628/174/f8c.gif!!","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"54a21fa16368727624580200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a21ecf6368725e88653000#post_54a21ecf6368725e88653000\r\nWell, the old version started in the end of the 90's.\r\nYou can recomend me one if you want :)","author":"5239db6da4c72d22d9000358"},{"id":"54a21fb36368726294331900","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a21f69636872688a530200#post_54a21f69636872688a530200\r\nalso doesn't help i have least 3 hours of youtube subscriptions everyday, among other daily things\r\n\r\n\"@Carcass Strife\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a21f906368722ce2370200#post_54a21f906368722ce2370200\r\nlies\r\neveryone faps","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"54a21ff36368727624850200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a21dc9636872260bc70a00#post_54a21dc9636872260bc70a00\r\nThey should be out now.
