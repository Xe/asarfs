Imagine if you had something broken and you fixed it by throwing out all the broken things until it eventually worked.  Simply put if you ask something along the lines of why say for instance my favorite color would be the combination of black and white in exact equal quantities in either symmetry or complex patterns I simply couldn't tell you cause there is no reason or logic as to why because while there is no logical reason why there is neither a illogical reason as to why not; trying to find logic or illogic there is like trying to find the mass of hypothetical earth's second moon and arguing about it, in any case there is no second earth moon therefore trying to find the mass of it is pointless.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"549a9c7e6368724d39330700","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/549a8f5863687249a9630300#post_549a8f5863687249a9630300\r\nNope\r\nYa good","author":"51a2815b7f123be59500049b"},{"id":"549aa14363687230e6100700","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Carcass Strife\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/549a02186368726b24dd0000#post_549a02186368726b24dd0000\r\nWait, what?!\r\nDude, are you being serious?","author":"515ddf93a4c72d8a1f000d57"},{"id":"549abbc76368722eaf6a0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"It's almost that time of the year again.","author":"4fdef063945b700a9d01604f"},{"id":"549abfee63687203d6450000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@AppleJackFrost\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/549abbc76368722eaf6a0200#post_549abbc76368722eaf6a0200\r\nTime for the annual virgin sacrifice already??\r\n\r\nAlright, everybody get in line and be counted for the lottery.
