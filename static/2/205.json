Who cares if someone who works really hard still can't make enough to pay rent and will be kicked out on the street? The company is making lots of money and the politician who invests in that company can now go buy a better car, and that's what really matters.","author":"5010fa077f123b1e4f00104e"},{"id":"5361b88a636872317d5a0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@someguy111\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5361b6e46368727f004c0000#post_5361b6e46368727f004c0000\r\n[bq=\"someguy111\"]\"@PaskaNaakka\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5361b496636872380d9a0000#post_5361b496636872380d9a0000\r\n...\r\nI...I can't\r\n\r\nSo even though he was right, the teacher was telling him to accept a lie and to not do anything about it. \"Blatant disregard for authority\"? So what this teacher is saying to to do something you know something you know is wrong or accept what you know is wrong. Methinks that teacher should be booted from the school, yet because they are teaching kids to be submissive and to take orders, the teacher would if anything get promoted.\r\n\r\nAnyway, this is now the stupid thread, post more stuff like this.

I once told her that just look at the housing boom talking about how it was a artificial boom due to the fed keeping interest rates low and said that it was doomed to eventually bust due to people buying houses they could never pay off and I was told that a housing market bust could never happen. . . . .\r\n\r\nSame thing happened with my government class too.  She was nice and all, but I tried explaining to her that because of Bush's low approval rating that democrats were going to win in 2006 and that historically speaking if a president's approval rating is low enough that no matter who their party's next candidate runs against they'll still lose. . . . . . .","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5361b9706368723a8b6b0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-tHrw-nJ2NyY/UPFqLstZemI/AAAAAAAAAKU/agyRMsKE7ZM/s1600/scan0068.jpg!","author":"50b70eeb7f123b1a02000097"},{"id":"5361b97263687223d8c40000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Whatevs\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5361b70663687262fad50000#post_5361b70663687262fad50000\r\nIf I'm not mistaken washington, oregan, california(Okay california's a bad example cause california's economy has been in the shitter for years), montana, colorado, arizona, new york, missouri, ohio, florida(Okay florida's a bad example as well), vermont, rhode island, conneticut and new jersey.\r\n\r\nDon't quote me on the number of states though.
