If there's a bunch of hidden files don't touch it.  Chances are there's a bunch of hidden files.  If it's not say your documents or such you probably shouldn't touch it.  If it's your documents, pictures or music file that's fine to shift delete.  If it's a bunch of copypasta file names that potentially is what you're looking for.\r\n\r\nYou should just say fuck it and just turn it in to get repaired.  At this point the \"fuck it\" option is probably better cause there's probably a bunch of serious problems with your computer.  It could be anything from corrupted installation to broken dll to hardware failure.\r\n\r\nYou should probably go with the \"fuck it\" option and just turn it in to get repaired cause this is one of those serious problems that sure I could fix if I was there, but telling you over the internet is far more difficult to do.  Without the serial key you're going to have to send it in for repairs anyhow so it's time to say, \"fuck it\" and just get it repaired.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"536207956368726ef0570000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Okay one more post before I go to bed:\r\nContinuing on from the previous page post about steamos; there will never be a virus for linux distros ever so you don't need to worry about this.  Why?  Cause _most_ actual hackers and not script kiddies use linux.  The second a actual hacker goes, \"I made a virus for linux go me!\" his 23 friends would immediately stab him to death out of rage that he made such a thing and his last words would be \"et tu brute\".\r\n\r\nIf you create a virus for linux you're going to piss a lot of people off that can within seconds ruin your life forever.
