hybrid?\r\n\r\nI'm trying to come up with a idea for a multiplayer map, but basically the concept is that it's like control point game modes where there's control points that you have capture.  The control points have turrets that if you aren't behind your, well let's face it, your minions it'll target you and blow you away and there's a central control point in order to get to you have capture the adjacent control points first.  The control points act as spawn points so if you capture the ones right next to the final one one you don't have to respawn at the start.\r\n\r\nBasically control points A and C once they're captured act as spawns, but once captures the turrets have half of their original health so the other team will would have a incentive to take it from you; control point B you have to capture A or C first.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5487525f6368725486430400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/548751e46368720c28690100#post_548751e46368720c28690100\r\nControl point spawns...
