He had a hamster a couple eyars ago. It was pretty old when I met him and he passed 4 moths ago. \r\n\r\nHe says that it happens if the hamster feels insecure about how you cut her nails and following their instincts, they decide to cut them themselves. But since they sometimes do it scratching the bottom of their cage which tends to be dirty most of the time (no offense), it makes the cartilage on the nails to infect.\r\n\r\nHe reccomended using nail file to try and reomve them, if it doesn't work. Take her to vet cause it may be an infection and she might have to take antibiotics to remove it.","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"5301472363687214d0700100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Medical question.\r\nIf you have an ingrown hair, is it best to pluck it after extraction or leave it alone?\r\nA few months back I decided to shave my...well my [spoiler]groin[/spoiler] for the first time in my life.

If it's bad bad then you need to go to the doctor; on the other hand if it's not too bad you can do it yourself.  The downside is it's going to hurt a lot.

Though how truth it may be, I don't know, I never had a hamster. You use a nail file weekly, just so that the nails don't curve so much and prevent them to get jammed in the cage or other places. Just the tip, that way, the claws grow straight and by the end of the month they  can be cut.","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"53017965636872085bb10100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"1,500 topics, whoo.","author":"4fde4484945b700aa0002cca"},{"id":"530179a26368720610ac0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Sono\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53017965636872085bb10100#post_53017965636872085bb10100\r\n[bq=\"Sono\"] \"1,500 topics, whoo.\":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvX_5ym_ajI [/bq]\r\n","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"53017a2f6368720763030200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@QuasarNova\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/530178a563687208cd680100#post_530178a563687208cd680100\r\n\r\nYeah, but nail growth rates might differ in hamsters to guinea pigs.
