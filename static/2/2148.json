Why do people don't care about killing people in games like GTA? Simple. Death in those games is worth nothing. You kill NPC's till your heart content, but they simply respawn and they are nothing except pixels. No personality, no nothing.\r\n\r\nHere on the other hand, every person reacts like a real person and they supposedly stay death and some of the scenarios are something people live every day and it really hits them home.\r\n\r\nNot saying that some opinions are exaggerated (That would be an effin' lie).","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"545eefcc6368725d37c30100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"im watching face off and.\r\n\r\ni cant believe it took me an hour to notice.\r\n\r\nnic cage is named castor\r\n\r\nand his brother pollux\r\n\r\nJUST LIKE THE GREEK MYTH","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"545ef01c6368727b32390200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Shadow the Hedgehog\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/545eee0e6368724db2be0100#post_545eee0e6368724db2be0100\r\nPostal 1 like Hatred seems to utterly lack a sense of humor, which puts it in a very different camp than Postal 2, GTA, ect. Even in more serious games where you can go on a killing spree (GTA IV and V come to mind) it is more contextualized as drama, the killing sprees aren't the whole point of the game.\r\n\r\nPersonally I look at Hatred and just roll my eyes. It looks fucking dumb as a brick, the sort of stupid angsty edgelord bullshit that 16 year old me would have drooled over.","author":"4f41ee04945b701c41002af7"},{"id":"545ef0596368724262400000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Twisty\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/545eefcc6368725d37c30100#post_545eefcc6368725d37c30100\r\n\r\nAdd the name of Travolta's character","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"545ef0ff63687274f3be0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@QuasarNova\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/545ef0596368724262400000#post_545ef0596368724262400000\r\n\r\nsean archer?\r\n\r\ni dont get that one tho","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"545ef12b6368727d74ee0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@QuasarNova\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/545eef7c636872683e890000#post_545eef7c636872683e890000\r\nYou probably will say the same with Postal 1.\r\n\r\n\"@gasmaskangel\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/545ef01c6368727b32390200#post_545ef01c6368727b32390200\r\nI thought the same thing after watching the trailer.","author":"5239db6da4c72d22d9000358"},{"id":"545ef204636872683ed30000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Twisty\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/545ef0ff63687274f3be0000#post_545ef0ff63687274f3be0000\r\n\r\nArcher = Sagittarius\r\n\r\nSagittarius is in the opposite of Gemini whose main constellations are?
