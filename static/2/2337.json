The human race used to be a little shit screamer that would beat up kids just cause they didn't get their way, then went through their little shit abnoxious years that would beat up the other kids if someone said they were wrong, then went through the awkward years when they realized that sex was good, then realized that stds are bad, right about now I'd have to say the human race is in the awkward \"anarchy\" shit years where they think they know everything and go around with \"tattoos\" and punk hair, but we're entering junior high where we're realizing that we have to grow up and think of a college to pick and where to work pretty soon.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"547681e36368720da1770000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/547680cc63687258e8a70100#post_547680cc63687258e8a70100\r\nNegative Mr. Squiggy, that would violate the prime directive.
