For example, an important jazz-funk combo from Barcelona, which has the very nice name of Pegasus, was back then an European jazz powerhouse. They often went to the Montreux Festival. \r\n\r\nBut time does not forgive, and the record company they worked for folded... Their latest album has been made with donations from the fans. So is doing 80s soul one-hit wonder (and one of my fav singers) Gregory Abbott with his latest 3 or 4 singles.\r\n\r\nEven relatively important people are publishing their own works. But this case you present is... Quite interesting from a librarian POV.","author":"531b80d363687229e73e0000"},{"id":"548ca0d56368723ddde50300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Shadow the Hedgehog\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/548ca043636872207d3b0000#post_548ca043636872207d3b0000\r\nWell, yeah.\r\nAnd the song in the Mombasa Streets mission.","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"548ca12d63687224aaa30100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"OMG, AND THEY ALL ACTUALLY SOUND GOOD\r\n\r\nWTF IS THIS KIND OF FUCKING SORCERY?\r\n\r\nIS THIS GUY A GOD?
