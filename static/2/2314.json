You should know that the worst way to deal with trolls is to give them more ammo, and by doing what gives them pleasure, which is to get angry at them, you are pretty much sending them the richest, most exquisite 8 course meal with ancient wine on a Sterling silver platter carried by the most exotic of supermodels. There is no black and white in this world, only gray and grey, nobody has it gravitating around them. All of us just stand on it, which stands on the solar system, which stands on the universe.\r\n\r\nYes, there is a stark difference between trolls and cyberbullies. trolls, by basic definition, create chaos with stupid or highly disagreeable acts for mere amusement. Some are even accidental, creating unintentional outrage by the sole sin of hinting something that makes an explosive reaction. Cyberbullies, on the other hand, do it solely to demean and terrorize. Also, trolls have their limits too. There will come to a time when they will regret it and it will always be too late. And those who don't, will be hated by the former as equally as by the common man. By legislating anti-troll laws, it will only spawn another breed of douchebags who will abuse it by sicking the law onto people who simply disagree with them. I hate to sound nihilistic, but in this world, nothing can be truly purged. That's why people say 'Don't feed the trolls'. As they say, if you can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen.\":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exiSUGTMLg4&list=UUOCs7lAn_5fZWhnqMOOYfXQ","author":"50d9a3aea4c72dc9b3000120"},{"id":"547487e36368726427760100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Shit. . . \r\nAnd today in crazy shit we have the KKK marching around in Ferguson\r\n!https://38.media.tumblr.com/08e9b08ac328ef642923d481e9d5bc49/tumblr_nfkugzflBC1rwh8nfo1_1280.png!\r\nI know it's rare of me to say this, but if you have the KKK holding marches in a city it's kind of hard to claim something isn't about race.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54748e0a6368726bc10a0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Oh trust me Uc, you didn't even have to post.\r\n\r\nThe news, people, Tumblr, everyone is exploding right now.\r\n\r\nI literally cant go anywhere (Not even here) and NOT see people talking about this,\r\n\r\nShits bad man.
