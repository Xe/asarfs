I believe 02 to be a stronger season as a whole than Adventure, but there were a lot of things in 02 that rubbed me the wrong way. [spoiler]Reusing Vamdemon/Myotismon as a villain just felt really lazy to me. And there were a lot of side plots that were pointless. Like the whole Daemon deal in the Human World.[/spoiler]\r\nAll in all. It was good and I can see why kids liked it.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"548391b963687221009c0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/548390a563687214834d0200#post_548390a563687214834d0200\r\nI've heard that not a lot of fans of adventure liked 02.","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"548392cd6368723f81c90200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/548390a563687214834d0200#post_548390a563687214834d0200\r\n\r\nYou liked Tommy Wiseau's perfomance as Oikawa?","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"548393186368720edb030300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@QuasarNova\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/548392cd6368723f81c90200#post_548392cd6368723f81c90200\r\nThat was just......weird","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"5483936a63687232efcc0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/548390a563687214834d0200#post_548390a563687214834d0200\r\nAre you going to start Tamers?","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5483941e6368721f1e600200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5483936a63687232efcc0100#post_5483936a63687232efcc0100\r\nYeah.
