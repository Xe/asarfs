I used to be a HUGE fanboy of the toys back during its prime, but now all I see is a reboot Bionicle, not the toyline/story I grew up playing, watching, and reading. I'm not trying to say it's bad, but as a reboot...I'm not sure if it captures the same spirit of the original. I mean, it looks like they're trying to retell the Mata Nui saga all over again, except it looks like they took out a whole bunch of stuff, and 'changed' some names to make it look like it's new or something.\r\n\r\nI'm glad its back, but I'm not took keen on the \"Hero Factory\" look of it, and I never liked Hero Factory. Not that it replaced it, but the toys don't even look \"Bionicle-ish\" to me. I honestly stop collecting Bionicles after the series ended back in 2010, and it was a dark and sad day for me. Heck, I don't even thing some of the stories after the end went anywhere. But I finally got to see Mata Nui give Makuta his just deserts after ALL OF THE CRAP HE GOT AWAY WITH. Too best the rest of the final battle was meh. It was almost like the end of the Lord of the Rings, except its just ends right at the point where Sauron dies, and people just go 'okay we won, now what?\"\r\n\r\nHope the new Bionicle becomes something great and amazing, but this new take on it is a far cry from the original take. I have faith in it, but I also have my doubts. It's just I'll have to get used to it. And I hope it becomes something worthwhile, for fans of new and old. I was there for the Old Legends, but it looks like a new story based on an old tale is about to be told...\r\n\r\n(inb4 Bionicle thread is created)","author":"536f7a11636872666e2d0000"},{"id":"54a17c6a6368720de4270e00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@ToskiHero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a17b5b6368727dc0da0600#post_54a17b5b6368727dc0da0600\r\nI honestly never kept up with the storyline\r\nThe new toys are decidedly hero factory looking though.
