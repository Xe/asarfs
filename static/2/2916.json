Short version is someone that's a employee at channel awesome(the people behind that guy with glasses, todd in the shadows, nostalgia chick and such) got pissed off and started distributing child porn to try and \"win\" against gamergate and now they're all defending child predators and such saying that cp should be legal saying that thinking cp should continue to be illegal is \"sexist\".  Obviously you know that I'm pro-gamergate so you know I'm bias, but personally I think if your movement is resorting to archiving cp and giving it to others then it's time for your movement to cut your losses, kiss some serious metaphorical ass and try to save face.  Honestly there's not enough facepalms in the world for what's been going on the last week cause anyone with a brain would tell you that it's time to save face.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54a223e76368724c063d0700","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a2231f6368724c06e10600#post_54a2231f6368724c06e10600\r\nReminds me of this\r\n[spoiler]!http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/858/518/71c.png![/spoiler]","author":"9ba2e84e636164642cc03200"},{"id":"54a2246b6368727c9bb21000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"So I just had a thought. Ganondorf is supposed to be the incarnation of Demise. No matter what happens, if Ganondorf is born he will seek to destroy everything. What would happen if one incarnation on Ganondorf DIDN'T want to destroy? What if he just wanted to live a normal life, fall in love, maybe have a child or two?
