If you want a higher military budget drive people up the wall with paranoia and say \"if you want to be protected spend money on the things I want\".  The grand irony is that the most effective means of trying to get rid of nukes would be to spread the actual factual information about them to get people complacent about spending money on the usa's government's budget so that they'll axe the budget towards it.\r\n\r\nI've had some dumb arguments with people before that have said that nukes would wipe out the entire human race.  No offense to anyone but arguing against gun nuts are the worst cause you explain the physics to them and they respond with \"nuh-uh if physics says I'm wrong then physics must be wrong\".\r\n\r\nWhat is probably going to happen the next couple of years is Russia's economy is going to collapse and it's going to be a repeat of the USSR.  What I mean by this is that after the USSR collapsed there was drastic reductions in the total number of wars in the world, drastic reduction in deaths due to war and drastic reduction of nukes in the world.  I'm totally admitting I'm a bad person for wanting their economy to collapse, but if it does collapse and it does in fact repeat what happened after the collapse of the USSR then the total number of nukes in the world should drop to at least a fourth of the current number; meaning that the number of nukes in the world and their yield will be so low that sure the USA and Russia will still be able to destroy each other, but everyone else will be fine.\r\n\r\nCall me crazy, but personally I think in 2030 there's only going to be about a thousand nukes left because if Russia's economy collapses then they're going to have to cut the military budget which means less nukes; Russia cutting their number of nukes means the USA will also cut their number; also the USA's military is massively overinflated budget wise right now and once the next president comes in there's going to be massive military budget cuts and probably nukes are going to get axed hard for the military to offset their budget cuts.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54a6860c63687232eb571800","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a682636368725cdfa51500#post_54a682636368725cdfa51500\r\nIf the bombs do fall, I doubt they'll target a country like mine. We even have a law that says no nuclear weapon shall ever be placed on Philippine soil. Power plants are fine, but we only use weapons that are 'enough'.
