As someone with a big appreciation for music, audio quality is important to me and therefor I make sure the player I use is tuned so I can listen to my music the way the artist intended. Try this: listen to a song on youtube. Now take that same song and play it with vlc and use the preset \"Full Bass and Treble\" under the graphic equalizer tab in the effects window. Make sure you have good quality headphones or speakers.","author":"5010fa077f123b1e4f00104e"},{"id":"5374ff3a6368722429b90400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@someguy111\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5374fdd463687227153a0400#post_5374fdd463687227153a0400\r\n\r\nif i listened to goblin the way tyler wanted id probably suffer some physical damage.\r\n\r\nbut i doubt windows player has all that shit.","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"537500b76368722589a70500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@twistedmetalero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5374ff3a6368722429b90400#post_5374ff3a6368722429b90400\r\nNo comment.\r\n\r\nAnyway, my question still stands; is there a real-time graphics equalizer that is software based and can be used with the master sound so no matter what program it is you can adjust the quality?

It sure does! It also has some neat effects too like bass boost and the \"wow\" effect. Also VLC has an equalizer and some nice effects too.
