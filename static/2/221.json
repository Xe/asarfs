Just because something is natural doesn't mean its good. If you eat broccoli without pesticides, you have probably eat a lot of caterpillars too. With genetic modification, we can have plants which kill insects that eat them, while not harming human beings. And in cultures that mainly eat rice, there is a high amount of vitamin A deficiency. \"Golden rice\":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_rice can fix this by giving rice the ability to synthesize beta-carotene. This makes the rice more, not less, nutritious. And GMOs are not completely unnatural. \"Gene transfer occurs naturally in nature.\":http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2013/01/01/how-a-quarter-of-the-cow-genome-came-from-snakes/\r\n\r\nThe Genetic Literacy Project, RationalWiki and Biofortified are good independent sources of GMO information.","author":"50b70eeb7f123b1a02000097"},{"id":"53686a22636872323eda0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Randomosaur\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/536869c163687246e5310000#post_536869c163687246e5310000\r\nThe problem with that is that It's very unlikely to create something that Just Harms Insects, It's very unlikely that it doesn't do some sort of damage to Humans, Also, Caterpillars?

It's not that we don't have enough food being made, rather it's that including transportation costs, production costs, farming costs/costs to raise cattle and so forth food is too expensive.\r\n\r\n\"Printed\" food(No it's different from 3D printing; I'm just using this term to make the process behind it easy to understand.

The disease really came from a lack of sanitation back then. Sewers were basically just troughs that waste was dumped in and flowed through the streets.
