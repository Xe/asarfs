The story, the characters, the animation, hell even the soundtrack were LEAGUES above the Adventure series. The interactions between the various Tamers and their Digimon were always interesting and varied. The D-Reaper made an AMAZING final villain and I was actually nervous during the final episode. My main problem with the series is, as stated, Ryo. If you cut Ryo from the story nothing would be lost.
