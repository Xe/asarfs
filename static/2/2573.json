There's been a abnormally large amount of shitstorms lately in a lot of fandoms the last couple of months and if I had to summarize all the drama going on it seems be geeks vs hipster pseudo geeks who are just trying to be trendy.  I guess the reason why all this shit started was that hipsters tried to get rid of geek culture and it didn't work out in their favour.\r\n\"@Twisty\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54853e5e63687255bb310000#post_54853e5e63687255bb310000\r\nLooks like someone should have bought building insurance.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"548542686368725a21c60000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"i feel it in my gut, this is the good one\r\n\r\n!http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/31853600104035313/6A29D2E05B2A94FEDE964E327137359C6DA1DE12/!","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"548542a56368725992c00000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/548540886368725259820000#post_548540886368725259820000\r\n\r\nCall me a dumbass, but I have no idea what hipsters want at the end of the day.","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"548543b36368721a88080000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/548540886368725259820000#post_548540886368725259820000\r\nI consider myself a hipster too. I'm into geek culture, but not as immersed in most of them as many of the real fans. I admire hipster culture.

Which, to be fair, alot of comics are made by men for men and with that a few problems arise as girls start reading them more, so they have reason.  That's the biggest issue there. Well that and a few decisions made by DC and or Marvel.\r\n\r\n","author":"500757fd7f123b75a90003b1"},{"id":"54854f376368722740020100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"25 Year Old Microwave Cake Mix | Ashens\":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eJiATvy7X4","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"}]}
