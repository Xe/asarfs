In two or three more it will be replaced by one of the big, triangular, serrated ones in a few days.\r\n\r\nI haven't left the house in weeks, not since I killed the neighbor's dog. Parts of it are still in my freezer and I think of it now as my tongue goes to the empty spot where one of my few human teeth used to be.\r\n\r\nGod I still remember that night, the scents so heavy in the air, the claws that split out of my fingers tearing divots in the earth as inhuman desire welled up in me.\r\n\r\nI wonder what they made of the dog's disappearance? Did they see the blood? I don't think I left much behind after I ripped open the animal's guts to get at the sweet meats within.\r\n\r\nI tried to be quick in my work. I didn't like killing the dog. I don't like the killing but God help me the flesh...\r\n\r\nCan you imagine the sweet tang of fresh blood bubbling into your mouth? So hot and thick you feel like you should eat it with a spoon. The flesh tearing around your fangs as you rip it from bone. The crunch of those bones as you snap them open to suck out the marrow...\r\n\r\nHow did I ever live without this ambrosia? I tried. I tried so hard to live like a normal person.\r\n\r\nBandages hid my twisted face and claws, and I kept my mouth shut so no one would see my teeth.\r\n\r\nSteaks worked at first, but eventually... well I had to start eating them raw. There's no flavor when you cook it, you can't taste the life in the meat when you cook it.\r\n\r\nThat lasted maybe a month before I needed more.\r\n\r\nI'll have to hunt again soon.\r\n\r\nSometimes I wonder if there are others out there like me, people huddling in their basement during the day, waiting for dark to fall so they can go out and find fresh flesh...\r\n\r\nI'll kill them if I find them. Can't have too many things like me running around, that would draw suspicion.\r\n\r\nA memory drifts into my mind, a window that my neighbors leave open in the summer.
