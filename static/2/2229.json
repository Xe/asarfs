You see, about two years ago my family had to move back to Finland from Estonia. On the plus side, i got my own apartment. On the downside, now all my friends live pretty far away on the other side of the sea. Also, my exceedingly rare sleep disorder that forces me to live a mostly nocturnal life and my anxiousness about meeting new people have kept me from making any new friends.\r\n\r\nSo, for the past two years, my only contacts with people have been limited to visits from my family, rare visits to my friends, and chatting to people online. This has of course lead to depression. I am seeing a psychiatrist about that.\r\n\r\nSo yeah. I am pretty firmly in the sweat closet. ^only finnish speakers will get that pun i'm afraid^ ","author":"5007bbdf7f123b112f00023a"},{"id":"5469e46b63687242f2050100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5469dca46368723b6e2a0400#post_5469dca46368723b6e2a0400\r\nThat's kinda badass actually.
