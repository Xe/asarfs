Kevlar body armor or such isn't designed for swords or such; if you took a rapier or something you could totally cut through it(albeit not easily).  Swordproof armor looks totally different and has a completely different function.  There are some bulletproof body armor designed to also block swords, but let's face is when was the last time anyone on a battlefield used a sword on the battlefield? *cough* Jack Churchill aka \"Mad Jack\" *cough*","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"547a73806368720723ce0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Twisty\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/547a72dc636872454a3f0000#post_547a72dc636872454a3f0000\r\nKinda depends on which kind of katana.
