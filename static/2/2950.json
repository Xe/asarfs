I don't think \"faggot\" will ever be \"taken back\" and turned into a regular word because the most common use for the word is still a derogatory term.  It'd be like if someone walked up to random woman and said \"What's up my whore?\" or such thinking it's perfectly fine and acceptable; I highly doubt most women would be happy to be called a whore or slut by random strangers. I know people try to take back the word, but considering that 95% of the time it's still used derogatory it's never going to become just another word.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54a46c01636872215f940000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Princess♠Molestia\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a46b9e6368727e7caf0100#post_54a46b9e6368727e7caf0100\r\n* burp *\r\n!https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-_aAG3mldg8U/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACI/8LHP8g9kCQs/photo.jpg!","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"54a46c42636872550d962900","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Shadow the Hedgehog\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a46bea636872215f840000#post_54a46bea636872215f840000\r\nI see your point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"@Carcass Strife\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a46bd2636872215f670000#post_54a46bd2636872215f670000\r\nIt's a soccer move that's considered to be physically impossible to stop in-universe","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"54a46c7b6368725794860f00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Princess♠Molestia\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a46b9e6368727e7caf0100#post_54a46b9e6368727e7caf0100\r\n!http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20111106144650/dragonballtechniques/images/b/bc/162_4.jpg!\r\nAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA- 5 minutes later- AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!!!
