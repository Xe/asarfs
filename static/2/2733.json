And I think I've figured it out.\r\nWhile Bayonetta and Satsuki-sama are both badass female characters, no attention is brought to their sex. Yes there is focus on the SEXUALITY of the characters but not on their gender. No one is shocked by these two women kicking all kinds of ass. The funny part about this is that despite being badass females, Bayonetta and Satsuki-sama are wildly different characters. Bayo is flamboyant, campy, and has a particular fondness for theatrics. Satsuki-sama is straight forward, no nonsense, and practical. Yet despite these differing characteristics they achieve the same thing.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54909de563687210977c0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54909c7e63687210834f0200#post_54909c7e63687210834f0200\r\nI can believe that!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","author":null},{"id":"54909f23636872181bc70100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54909c7e63687210834f0200#post_54909c7e63687210834f0200\r\nnow I wanna see _THAT_ crossover\r\nbayonetta just needs to be in everything","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"54909fba6368721490120300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54909f23636872181bc70100#post_54909f23636872181bc70100\r\nI wanna see Bayonetta fighting Satsuki.\r\nAnd then they team up to kick Ragyo's ass in Hell.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54909ffe6368721083a60200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54909f23636872181bc70100#post_54909f23636872181bc70100\r\n\r\n\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54909fba6368721490120300#post_54909fba6368721490120300\r\nWhy was I on Anon?
