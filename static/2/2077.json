Not just because it runs the risk of alienating your audience if it's too out there, but because there's always that chance that someone, _somewhere_ has already had that same idea. And particularly in regards to video games, originality carries with it a great deal of risk, and most of the time, that risk isn't one financial backers are willing to take.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying that any of that is _right_. That's just how it is.","author":"5043cdb47f123b72cc0032d3"},{"id":"545886716368724483b20300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/545883de6368725d71950200#post_545883de6368725d71950200\r\nWell you are aware of the phrase \"There's no such thing as an original idea\" right? I mean you can take a generic idea or plot and make it intersting. Hell the whole plot of One Piece is \"Guy gets a crew and goes on a big dumb adventure.\" Not exactly mind-wracking stuff. But where One Piece shines is in it's characters and world-building. Same with Persona 3. Persona 3's story is the most video game-y story you will ever see but's still interesting to watch the characters deal with the potential armageddon they have to face. What I mean is that there is a difference between being genuinely creative and just over-compensating.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"545886a36368723c7a590100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Silent_Witness\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/545885d46368724430910200#post_545885d46368724430910200\r\nYeah I know; the paradox here is that it's a risk to do something original but at the same time not doing something original is also a financial risk.  To use a analogy it's like how call of duty is dying hard right now and chances are it's going to send tremors in the games industry when it does go under cause chances are the reaction will be \"oh my god!
