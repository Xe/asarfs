Further, it's keeping me from looking into high performance RAM too because the high heat and higher speeds seem to me like it would almost be begging for an error.","author":"5010fa077f123b1e4f00104e"},{"id":"536a25e76368727c8f760000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Name the most ironically loved movies (including cult films like Reefer Madness or The Room), go!","author":"50d9a3aea4c72dc9b3000120"},{"id":"536a4af163687245ac0b0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"You know what is going to be funny when it actually happens?
