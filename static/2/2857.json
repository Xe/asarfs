video games are getting progressively cheaper and cheaper when you take into inflation.  *Most* of the video game industry gets it that people want cheaper games.\r\nThere's multiple problems though; well for one some AAA companies think that people want more expensive games which is why you see shit like Destiny where dlc is was already planned from day one and they expect you to pay $60 on top of that $60 for the game believing that people want games that cost $120.\r\nThe secondary problem is that people are afraid to go freemium cause they see the crap capcom and company pull and the backlash and think that people fundamentally hate freemium games even if it's like TF2's system or LoL's system and are afraid that any game that is free2play will have backlash.\r\nThe third problem is that a lot of companies push that $60 mark super super super hard even if the game doesn't warrant it and if the game doesn't need to be $60 AAA companies push the idea of \"then you make it cost $60\".\r\n\r\nI totally agree that there is a cost problem, but don't blame valve; blame companies like crapcom, EA or such ramming their cock down people's throats.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"549c99e46368724f62790000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/549c99406368724c74690000#post_549c99406368724c74690000\r\nRULES OF MY OWN COLLECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"549c9a1263687248ca8b0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://i938.photobucket.com/albums/ad223/NerdAlt/Tirou%20do%20Bau/tb_wp001_zps8704cd35.jpg!","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"549c9b2d6368724fc9b70000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"holy shit.\r\n\r\nferg is making me cry\r\n\r\nhe has a song about ferguson, fans and friends.\r\n\r\nand is truly making me emotional","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"549c9dd363687272c80e0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I literally took a nap thinking it was going to be a few seconds, Fucking woke up at 6:25! \r\n\r\n\r\nDAMMIT CHRISTMAS!","author":"50c204917f123b31440000a5"},{"id":"549c9f1763687274be230000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"They had these adult one piece pajamas at the store that were pink and had fur around the neck\r\nIf they had any anywhere near my size I would have bought the shit out of that fuck\r\n","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"}]}
