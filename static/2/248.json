The traditional sense is that you have to either have cgi, traditional animation or flash animation.  Flash animation can't do everything and sometimes looks wonky.  A lot of times cgi is used poorly.  Traditional animation is expensive.  I like to call RWBY pseudo anime in that they try to make it like a anime with cgi; which hasn't really been done before all that much.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"536ed4ed63687263158f0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/536ed4b463687261b33e0000#post_536ed4b463687261b33e0000\r\nYou're alive!","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"536ed5256368726126940000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"Kids were so edgy back then.\":http://www.cracked.com/article_21107_9-unintentionally-terrifying-old-timey-childrens-toys.html","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"536ed57d6368725ffcd70000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/536ed4ed63687263158f0000#post_536ed4ed63687263158f0000\r\n[bq=\"SquiggyBomb\"]\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/536ed4b463687261b33e0000#post_536ed4b463687261b33e0000\r\nYou're alive![/bq]\r\nLong car drive + Not deep enough sleep in car to count as a sleep cycle + 2 hours of sleep that night = Extremely tired\r\n\r\n\r\nI took a nap earlier and feeling a bit better.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"536ed5a76368726243970000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Well my father called me and talked about jury selection, and it occurred to me why the Nigerian Prince scheme is still used.\r\n\r\nIt's so well publicized that anyone who takes it remotely seriously is already gullible and is automatically a good mark.
