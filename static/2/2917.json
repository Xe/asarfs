I don't think anyone would argue against the notion that a country is economic stagnation, recession, depression or such has lower birth rates because less people have children during times of economic stagnation.  I totally agree with you about how blaming otakus is nearsighted cause they're spending all that time blaming otakus instead of trying to boost the economy.  Imagine if during the housing crash instead of all the governments trying to recover the economies they instead spent all their time blaming say gamers for the housing crash and then whenever them shaming gamers didn't work rather than admit they were wrong spent even more time shaming gamers thinking that if they shamed gamers hard enough it would recover the economy.\r\n\r\nEventually Japan will bounce back, but we're not talking for another decade cause the people currently in power are kind of stupid.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54a2250f6368724f15ac0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a224c16368726151db0700#post_54a224c16368726151db0700\r\nI know!\r\nI want Ganondorf's story!","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54a22565636872787f311900","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Shadow the Hedgehog\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a2246e6368727f5b290600#post_54a2246e6368727f5b290600\r\nThere is no next page option.
