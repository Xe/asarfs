A combination between seasons one, two and three and four conceptually.  What I mean by this is that the digimon has multiple potential digivolutions, they have boosts and such.  If you're having a hard time imagining what I mean is that basically the digimon have multiple champion levels each with their own weaknesses and that the digidestined can use boosts to offset; so like two champions, four ultimate levels and a omega that only comes at the end of the series.  I know each digimon has like twenty digivolutions, but having every digivolution available would get crazy.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"547b84ba6368722f84670100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Huh.
