Food that's produced by big corporations for the sake of profit and grown in synthetic fertilizers and pesticides and possibly exposed to radiation. Real food, like the kind the human body is supposed to eat, grows naturally with little to no human intervention. Sure we could feed the people of the world the food Americans eat, hut don't be surprised when half of them drop dead from heart attacks from all the saturated fats or develop obesity. [/bq]\r\nYou do realize that synthesized food wouldn't have any of these saturated fats, cholesterol and so forth right?  If a food has no contiminates, chemicals, pesticides, no cholesterol, no saturated fats, no chance of allergic reaction, no dangerous substances in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso here's a massive slap to the face:\r\nMost soil in the usa is polluted to some level anyways and especially around cities or places where factories have been and so forth.  Living off the land without actually looking into past owners is actually dangerous.  There has been cases of people getting sick from home gardens after they found out their house was built on a graveyard or such.  You're actually more at risk from home gardens than store bought food.  The reason being is that you could straight up be consuming asbestos or even radioactive material if you're that unlucky.  People have actually died from stuff like this before.  There's a reason why there's so much legal paperwork when it comes to farming.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"536886c76368726d96a60000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Randomosaur\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5368864f63687259f0d40000#post_5368864f63687259f0d40000\r\nThat's just an example of selective pressure and natural selection which I would think you would be well aware of.","author":"5010fa077f123b1e4f00104e"},{"id":"53688703636872792f520000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5368858163687253ed5c0000#post_5368858163687253ed5c0000\r\n\r\nBecause I don't enjoy mechas like you?
