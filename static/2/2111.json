Long post time!\r\n[spoiler]We open on Derek. Standing outside his grandmother's house. It's been ten years since he's seen his family. He called them beforeheand and they agreed to meet here so they can here his big announcement. Derek apprehensively opens the door and the eye's of the room are upon him. His monther, father, grandparents,  older brother, and various aunts and uncles all look at him and then his father pipes in. \"Derek! What have you been up to the past ten years\"he says jovially. Derek rubs his arm. \"Not much dad. Teaching...\" It's then that grandma notices something shiny on Derek's left hand. \"Why Derek is that a wedding band I see in your finger?\" Derek looks at his grandmother nervously. \"Yeah. That's kind of the  reason I called you all here.\" He looks  at the front door and yells \"You can come in now.\" In comes a tall man with brown hair and striking green eyes. \"Everyone this is my husband Alex.\" The family goes quiet for what seems like an eternity. Grandmother is the first to break the silence. \"Well Alex come in and tell us about yourself.\" It's then that a loud voice comes from outside. \"I'm coming in now too! It's cold as a witch's tit out here!\" In come's a woman with brunnette hair, blue eyes, and a strangely athletic figure. Derek's mother looks at her. \"And who is this?\" Derek and Alex both glance at it each other, look to the family, and simultaneously say, \"Well. This is our wife Beth.\" Beth simply smiles at the family and the screen goes black revealing the title card.
