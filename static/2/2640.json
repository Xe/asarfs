So, he instead revived a monster the size of the Juubi and wrecked havoc all over the place to harvest enough Spirit energy to do so. This lasted for almost 2 years until a prince (6 years old) sacrificed his life to destroy the monster. Afterwards, Red was \"created\" and captured by the kingdom. Red resembled the prince but with red hair and had no memories of his past. Truth is, the prince's dying soul and body merged with the monster's and created Red (at that moment had no name). Red was tortured and stuff due to the king (not the prince's dad btw) blaming himself on the prince's death.\r\n\r\nThe king's a nice person but you know, it was a heart-crushing situation to know that the monster is still alive and now looks like the prince he vowed to protect.\r\n\r\nRed also has a demon in him (which constantly argues with Red's Elemental Spirit) which was born due to some maniac scientist using him as a living battery. This damaged Red's body and soul, leaving him with the large scar that was known as Red's left arm. \r\n\r\nThere was one thing I was proud when writing Red's tragic childhood. Even though Red was tortured and stuff, he never cried. This is because Red has no feeling and memories at the moment so he never knew what happiness and sadness was at the moment and only smiled. Only when he was \"saved\" but scientist who treated him kindly that he understood happiness and sadness.\r\n\r\nThere are other secrets revolving Red but that's a story for another time.","author":"4fe1b9f47f123b13df002976"},{"id":"548a60416368725e6a010000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@HJSDGCE\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/548a5dce6368725c50310000#post_548a5dce6368725c50310000\r\nQuestion: Why didn't they just kill him?\r\n\r\nOver all you've got some solid bones for a fantasy adventure story if I do say so myself. Red seems like a competant and dangerous character without feeling over powered, which is a hard balance to maintain. Personally I believe that the key to keeping that balance is to make sure that in any conflict they're always punching up. I recommend Jim Butcher's books as an excellent example of this, The Dresden Files in particular.","author":"4f41ee04945b701c41002af7"},{"id":"548a63636368725dd9070000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!https://38.media.tumblr.com/bb816502806950e483ad0fb9d962f875/tumblr_ng74dve5gU1qjtzkco1_1280.jpg!","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"548a65586368720e4c2a0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!https://31.media.tumblr.com/e5776be9de4ba0301a7029304edc100c/tumblr_ng8irlSgZz1qg49d5o2_1280.jpg!","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"548a65686368720e4c2f0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"So I fought one of my Favorite guys Lythero in Umvc3 today!\r\n\r\n!http://i.imgur.com/KMwOEK0.gif!\r\n\r\nHe kicked the shit out me!
