What the latest breakthrough is that they take the patient's T-cells(part of the immune system) inject them with a rare mutation of the CCR5 gene, inject it back into the patient and presto.  There also may be a cure for cancer as well; a woman had experimental gene therapy done and her immune system as a result started attacking cancer cells.\r\n\"@twistedmetalero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/536cf1056368725f34370000#post_536cf1056368725f34370000\r\n[bq=\"twistedmetalero\"]\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/536cf066636872603c6b0000#post_536cf066636872603c6b0000\r\n\r\nthere is people who refuse to take vaccines today, there will be people not willing to get nanomachines in the future.[/bq]\r\nIt's cause of crap like this that polio is back.

So the last couple months they've defended racists, sexists, homophobes, are digging up nearly twenty year old news calling it news under the pretence of \"freedums!\"\r\n\r\nIt's official I have lost any and all respect for 24/7's credibility.  At this rate ten years from now we're going to see protests, political rallies and news featuring racists, sexists and homophobes trying to stop \"discrimination against my freedoms!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere's a fucking wake up call to the 24/7 news and anyone else that thinks freedom of speech means only freedom of speech towards individuals of a like mind; free speech means freedom of prosecution from the government for what you say, it does not cover threats, threatening people and just cause a person has the right to be racist/sexist/homophobe doesn't mean they have to be protected and coddled like a infant from those \"big bad meanies\".  If someone is racist/homophobic or sexist it is totally within a company's rights to fire you for this cause freedom of speech does not cover your ass when you're in hot water.  If you say something racist/sexist/homophobic at work there is a damn high chance that you're going to get fired for this cause freedom of speech does not cover this.\r\n\r\nMy problem with these people is that they're going on about \"freedoms\" while demanding special legal protection that excludes anyone that doesn't believe the same thing as them.  You want to know why so many people are getting fired for this shit lately?  Cause you didn't fucking look at your company's rules for being a employee.  If you're racist/homophobic/sexist or so forth and your company says they're a equal opportunity employer you're going to wind up getting your ass fired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTl:dr; I'm getting tired of the dumbasses on the news.  Freedom of speech covers freedom of prosecution for unpopular opinions against the government it does not mean freedom to say whatever the hell you want whenever you want or to whatever extreme you want.  If you're racist/homophobic/sexist and you work for a equal opportunity employer it's 100% within the company's rights to fire you.  If you're so concerned about your \"freedums\" then go work at a company that isn't a equal opportunity or stfu already.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"536d1e416368726893cc0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/536d1d9a6368726a90440000#post_536d1d9a6368726a90440000\r\n[slow clap]\r\nI need to buy you a drink sometime.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"536d1edb6368726ac5260100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"can someone here please explain me in english what anapestic tetrameter is? i mean most of the explanations dont make a lick of sense to me.\r\n\r\n\r\napparently the song \"the way i am\":http://rapgenius.com/Eminem-the-way-i-am-lyrics is written like that but i fail to see how.
