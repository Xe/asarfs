To give a example of what I mean take the 1960's tv show batman; it's so cheesy it should be considered torture.  Another example is Batman & Robin (1997); the only redeeming thing about the movie is Mr Freeze cause for one I like puns and two I like villains who are morally gray.  Say what you will about the movie the plot about him trying to save his wife was really the only good thing about the movie.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"547b57f06368723f80bc0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@xWoofyhoundx\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/547b561e636872640b710200#post_547b561e636872640b710200\r\nNo, it's not that good.
