Here's a general advice and maybe you'll find it useful, but you can send a message if you think you could use further help.\r\n\r\nIt's no coincidence most household problems reach their peek during the teenage years, it becomes a very turmoil time for everyone for a number of reason: Expenses increase, puberty begins to kick our balls more ways than none, plus other problems that were dragged along from years prior.\r\n\r\nNo one is born knowing how to raise a family and there's a saying (at least in these part of the world) that reads \"Everyone is and makes a mistake\". We make as much if not more mistakes that our predecessors and constantly failing on that only adds it more to the fire.\r\n\r\nIf you have a good relationship with your parents, something must be getting to them, sometimes we are the cause even if indirectly and there's nothing wrong with going and ask what's bothering them. Talk and figure something out.\r\n\r\nIf your family ties are that in name only, then it's even more delicate because in order to cope with misfortunes, people almost by default need to have a finger point at someone to blame for what happened. It's not right neither in short nor long term but alas, we do it anyways.\r\n\r\nWhat am I trying to post with this long as wall? That if there's something bothering your parents, and you have a good relationship with them, then go talk to them. If it's a bad side of a relationship, chances are they're angry at  for proxy, you're the closest \"target\".\r\n\r\nThose are usually the cases that situation gives birth to","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"54a081176368726af1fe0500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@QuasarNova\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a07d1463687257447d0a00#post_54a07d1463687257447d0a00\r\nI believe that the \"mistake\" part is my problem here. I don't think my parents understand that I am really clumsy. They don't accept that and take it as an excuse. When I drop something on the floor that make noises, my dad give me a dirty look, and when I lose something, my parent are disappointed in me. They really don't like it when I talk back to them, and I feel that they think I don't deserve the right to free speech.\r\n\r\nMy parents get angry at my sister more than me, but when it happen to me, they release more anger than my sister. They take stuffs away from me, but never from my sister.\r\n\r\nI'm their favorite child, but I get more stuff out of them than my sister, I suppose.\r\n\r\n-Holy shit, this is my longest comment yet.-","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"}]}
