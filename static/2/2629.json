I mean current state of International Relations between the US and well pretty much the rest of the world. I need a point of reference to work on for a fanfic of mine and also for future reference when I do economics. \r\n\r\nThe fanfic is something rather complicated, mainly aimed directly at politics and relations building between Equestria and the rest of the world. Especially when resources are involved, like opening the stock market to a place where gold and precious stones are more common than anywhere on Earth. \r\n\r\nAlso how Russia might perceive a new pool of resources as a threat to its economy, if Europe can gain access to tons of raw resources from somewhere else, Russia might end up in economic turmoil again. Also dealing with population issues and expanding human knowledge, in regards to magic. \r\n\r\nAlso maybe America starting proxy wars for resources with the Griffon kingdoms or in Zebra lands, seriously the government might actually do it. Why not?

The reason why I stopped you here for a second is back when I was a brony when I still read fanfics the vast majority of the political fanfics were extremely fucking stupid on a basic level.

But I know what you are getting at, the idea about how writers make rather obvious oversights is something noticeable we have next to no idea how things in the real world of economics actually work, at least not to the degree at which the stock market in full extent runs. We rely on what we know and how much we can gauge from either Wikipedia or other sources. \r\n\r\nSad reality, we suck at economics unless we're studying it, then we suck at something else. I'm just running on the basic principle that Equestria runs on a resource based economy which thrives off of productivity and social stability. \r\n\r\nWhile we're just people who live in a world which has become twisted around us rather heavily. We are not a perfect race, but hey we're not all dumbasses. \r\n\r\n\r\n\"@Whatevs\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/548a087c6368720db5700000#post_548a087c6368720db5700000\r\nYeah I can get where that's going to end up going, the US has made a ton of mistakes and rather intentional acts which would usually be seen as the incitement of warfare. There are a lot of concerns on whether or not the future is really going to become any worse, and from how things are looking now. That's probably yes. \r\n\r\nThrowing Equestria into this mix with the current state of affairs of 2015, is pretty much how America would affect our peace loving and very wealthy neighbors who are more socialist than anything else, just in my opinion they seem rather socialist like despite being run by a monarchy. \r\n\r\nAlso with so much wealth the US Government would have a field day trying to convince the locals to support them in their effort to bolster the economy. By offering the American way of life, and a fair amount of guns and weapons by sparking off conflicts with neighboring nations and so forth. \r\n\r\nWhat could possibly go wrong there?
