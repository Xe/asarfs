Even if he got help chances are it would have turned out the same cause speaking from experience most psychologists fall into two categories when it comes to helping those with suicidal thoughts: the crams down fifty different types of medication till they can't think straight but are so doped up that everyone thinks the underlying problem is fixed kind; or the generic \"hang in there kitty\" posters plastered on the walls kind.\r\n\r\nTo use an analogy think of trying to overcome suicidal thoughts and such as someone trying to run a marathon race with a 500lb weight roped to them.  Psychologists and most \"professionals\" are like a coach that keeps whistling at you believing you can you do it.  The people that don't understand how hard it is like a person that sees the 500lb weight and thinks there's no reason why it should slow them down.  Helping someone with depression takes multiple people all dragging that weight together to help them across the finish line.\r\n\r\n\"When you can’t run, you crawl, and when you can’t crawl, when you can’t do that you find someone to carry you.\"","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"549e893a636872615fe80800","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I knew him too\r\nI couldn't do anything because I only knew him online.\r\nApparently his phone broke and I was unable to get into contact with him....\r\nI feel so guilty.\r\nI wish I could have stopped him.\r\nI loved him.
