The reason why is that we already have the technology for mass production, but the problem right now is that it would cost twice as much for a burger patty.  I say ten years cause five years until it starts getting cheap enough to be realistic and another five years it passes the FDA for being safe.\r\n\r\n\r\nActually this could very well save the human race.  The reason why there's two billion people on the planet that struggle to survive is because they're too poor to afford food and so forth.  If you replace current food production with synthesized food then not only will that make being able to afford food a reality, but the amount of farmland needed in the world drastically allowing for nature to retake most of the land used.  Imagine how much that would change the world to have all the land we use for farming to allow nature to retake it considering that the largest reason for deforestation is to make new farmland.  Now imagine how much that would reduce pollution.\r\n\r\n\"@someguy111\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53687ac963687264e92a0000#post_53687ac963687264e92a0000\r\nNo one is saying you would have to eat synthesized food, but think about it from another perspective; are you really saying a technology that can save *BILLIONS* of lives is something that people shouldn't as a whole embrace under the pretence of it not being natural and therefore wrong?
