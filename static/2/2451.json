[/bq]\r\nDude; no, just no.  A actual mech wouldn't be of any tactical use and would be about as bulletproof as paper because as machines get larger they require exponentially more energy to move.\r\n\r\nInb4 someone goes \"what about aircraft carriers\" and ignores that it's a boat.\r\n\r\nA real life gundam able to fly and move that fast would require fusion energy or else it would be moving less than a tenth of a mile *A DAY*.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"547e50f46368727bace20100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Albus Fahrenheits\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/547e50bb636872053bec0100#post_547e50bb636872053bec0100\r\n[bq=\"Albus Fahrenheits\"]I'm eating coffee right now.[/bq]\r\n\r\nLOGIC.","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"547e51f86368721a9f740000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Carcass Strife\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/547e50f46368727bace20100#post_547e50f46368727bace20100\r\nThat's the stuff!\r\n\r\nAlso, which country do you think would be the first to develop power armour?\r\nI heard Germany's working on it.","author":"52f0834d63687261cba90300"},{"id":"547e53526368720513380200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"God dammit woolie, stop talking shit about the cg clone wars cartoon \r\nIt wasn't bad\r\nJesus","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"547e53e36368727b7a510200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/547e50e16368727bddaf0100#post_547e50e16368727bddaf0100\r\n\r\nYeah the tech is possible Thorium power source, it uses nuclear residue from actual fission reactors to produce equivalent or higher level of power. Though it's still in development its theoretically possible to create smaller reactors from something like that. \r\n\r\nAs for the machine itself we've got Carbon Nano-tubes man it's not going to be long before they figure out a lightweight design for armour with high density and hardness to use for such machinery. It's all theoretical though, it's a work in progress. \r\n\r\nCan't expect everything to work out right away. I mean they may take 5 or 15 years before such a thing is ready, you know they had a back up plan to just build a Zaku model next to the Gundam in Japan and then build the real thing later. \r\n","author":"5046d66d7f123b38980018c6"},{"id":"547e544063687207622d0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/547e53526368720513380200#post_547e53526368720513380200\r\nSpeaking of Star War.\r\nI noticed Jesus became a Sith.","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"547e545563687207d4c60200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/547e53526368720513380200#post_547e53526368720513380200\r\n\r\nI actually didn't mind that, they were actually getting better at making the show more mature as they progressed through the season, of course not everything was great, that last one was a real mess thanks to the fact that it got cancelled, we got a rather half arsed kind of ending though, damn I really wanted to know what happened to Ahsoka, she just vanished or apparently got killed thanks to the writers.
