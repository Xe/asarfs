First off a fair number of those 20 year olds \"giving everything\" weren't doing so by choice, but because they were fucking drafted and obscene numbers of them died screaming in the mud wishing they were anywhere but the living hell they were thrust into. Second the reason kids these days \"want everything\" is the same reason every goddamned generation has wanted everything, and frankly they aren't the ones who shit up the global economy. The current generation is no better or worse than any of the previous ones, and that fucking attitude is held by goddamn everyone who wants to feel smug and superior.\r\n\r\nAs for the music crack, same. 99% of all music created is shitty, forgettable pop songs and it has been this way since the birth of the goddamn recording industry. The reason we've got all these classics, like The Beatles is because they stood out among the gibberish and in thirty years people will be saying the same damn thing about... I don't know, Kanye West or someone.","author":"4f41ee04945b701c41002af7"},{"id":"54a3310f6368724cb3801800","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@gasmaskangel\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a330d86368720ef9862a00#post_54a330d86368720ef9862a00\r\nNow if only I could convince my granddad this.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54a33143636872084ebe0c00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a330cd6368727669092300#post_54a330cd6368727669092300\r\n\r\nfiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiine","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"54a33183636872789a9d0300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Twisty\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a33143636872084ebe0c00#post_54a33143636872084ebe0c00\r\nGood boy.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54a3319963687208dfc00e00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a33183636872789a9d0300#post_54a33183636872789a9d0300\r\n\r\ni just had to write an article about it\r\n\r\nand i found all these images too good to not share","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"54a332ba6368720a45840900","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@gasmaskangel\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a330d86368720ef9862a00#post_54a330d86368720ef9862a00\r\n[bq=\"gasmaskangel\"]\"@Twisty\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a32ddc63687234d6f61700#post_54a32ddc63687234d6f61700\r\n\"@Twisty\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a32d916368727aeaa80500#post_54a32d916368727aeaa80500\r\n I don't know, Kanye West or someone.[/bq]\r\n\r\nhigly wishing death grips become the dead kennedys or iron maiden of today for the future","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"54a3330d636872280ad81700","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!https://img0.derpicdn.net/img/download/2014/12/30/796122__safe_pinkie+pie_fluttershy_animated_cute_adorable_adorable+as+fuck_tickling_shyabetes_diapinkes.gif!","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"54a3334d6368721e98890600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"oh boy, ok ok i have to post this\r\n\r\n!http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/888/635/f93.jpg!","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"54a333656368720179511600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130328154522/ultra/images/8/89/Mebius_Rise.jpg!\r\nMebius!","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"54a333996368727789f31000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Twisty\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a3334d6368721e98890600#post_54a3334d6368721e98890600\r\nDid my granddad draw this?","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54a333b463687270133c0c00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Twisty\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a3334d6368721e98890600#post_54a3334d6368721e98890600\r\nYES.","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"54a334e26368725aadd71c00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Twisty\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a3334d6368721e98890600#post_54a3334d6368721e98890600\r\nPolitical cartoons are the single lowest form of humor.","author":"4f41ee04945b701c41002af7"}]}
