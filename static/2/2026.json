The voice acting is _super bad_. Plus there wasn't nearly enough of it. Korra's combat sounds and little quips just repeat, repeat and repeat. \r\nThe combat definitely has some platinum flavor but it didn't quite have the same oomf. \r\nFighting larger enemies was kind of a pain because it barely felt like I was doing anything half the time. \r\n\r\nI'd still take it over god of war.
