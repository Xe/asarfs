It's not that your theory is wrong, but rather actual japanese culture is different from how it's portrayed and that not a lot of westerners understand how socially conservative japan is.\r\n\r\nAnimation in japan is massively looked down upon by society, but you were right about it being a generational thing.  Right now in japan animation fans and such are the residential kicking bag for all the country's problems to the point it's the equivalent of the \"thanks obama\".\r\nCountry is in economic stagnation?  Thanks otakus.\r\nCountry's birth rates are down due to economic stagnation?  Thanks otakus.\r\nChina-Japan relations are strained due to them both vying for resources?  Thanks otakus.\r\nMassive anti-immigration stances preventing immigration to offset the large scale population decline due to old age?  Thanks otakus.\r\n\r\nThere's a lot of problems going on in japan right now because the country is in economic stagnation and decline and otakus are just outright getting the metaphorical crap kicked out of them for shit they didn't do.  Anime is looked down upon as just for children and adult anime fans are getting blamed for things that doesn't make a lick of goddamn sense.\r\n\r\nI know it was a bit of tangent, but it's a interesting tangent cause you are totally 100% right about there being a generational issue in japan.  The generational issue in japan is rather that the older generations have completely ran the country into the fucking ground and are taking it out on the younger generations.\r\n\r\n[/tangent]","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54a21a0e6368727669400700","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Carcass Strife\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a21956636872639d801100#post_54a21956636872639d801100\r\nC0M3 0N B4TCH 1VS1 COD R8 N0W\r\n\r\n\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a219696368725617550000#post_54a219696368725617550000\r\nWatch Hunter X Hunter","author":"5239db6da4c72d22d9000358"}]}
