as a character is just too over the top for me take seriously \r\nIt also has this issue of scale where the first boss is several times larger than the planet\r\nAnd then every other thing is your

is an annoying assclow, probably the least one i like so far.\r\ntavros is strangely cute and i really feel bad for the poor guy.\r\nim sure you already know my stance on terezi.\r\nkanaya is also one of my favorites since she atleast isnt hotheaded and goes for more rational approaches.\r\nvriska also annoys me for some reason, maybe is the way she talks.\r\ngamzee is so far cool, his stoned personality is kinda funny.\r\nnepeta a cutie.\r\nand i dont got anything for the rest, maybe they need to be introduced
