Why does this matter?  If Russia does attack Ukraine, while the sanctions against Russia right now are more of a political cockfight, Russia's economy will pretty much be nonexistent afterwords due to their reliance on the stock market.  The reason why so many third world countries get away with land grabs is they do not have a stock market.  They can do whatever they want and not have to face economic repercussions, only military repercussions; Russia on the other hand has a stock market and thus if they go through with Ukraine then bye bye Russia economy.\r\n\r\nIf Russia does go to war with Ukraine the war will look like this:\r\n\"Russia has taken effective control of Ukraine\"\r\nTwo weeks later\r\n\"Russia's economy has effectively collapse and the entire country's economy is nonexistent\"\r\n\r\nNo offence to anyone living in Russia, but the people that are glad that the country is facing sanctions are kind of stupid.  If Russia does actually face *REAL* sanctions, and not just the for showing off kind, then bye bye Russia economy.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5364727f63687240985a0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"NATO has declared Russia the enemy.","author":"50b70eeb7f123b1a02000097"},{"id":"536473d963687231f4580000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"War never changes\r\n!http://pics.kuvaton.com/kuvei/opening_salvo_of_the_war_against_the_clowns.gif!","author":"5007bbdf7f123b112f00023a"},{"id":"536474a56368721eb1ce0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Randomosaur\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5364727f63687240985a0200#post_5364727f63687240985a0200\r\n[bq=\"Randomosaur\"]NATO has declared Russia the enemy.[/bq]\r\nThe situation Russia is in right now in gif form:\r\n!http://media1.giphy.com/media/Dih00rZQ4ExWM/giphy.gif!","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5364761f6368723e38420100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/536474a56368721eb1ce0000#post_536474a56368721eb1ce0000\r\nI just hope New Zealand doesn't get involved.","author":"50b70eeb7f123b1a02000097"},{"id":"536477276368727e727d0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Randomosaur\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5364761f6368723e38420100#post_5364761f6368723e38420100\r\nStats wise NATO has a combined force of 3.37 million whereas russia only has 766 thousand.
