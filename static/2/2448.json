Christmas is coming.\r\n\r\nI love holidays and all and I definitely feel the spirit, but it's also kind of depressing for me.  The reason is as much as I have holiday spirit coming out my ass I have only ever been given a legit present once and thrown a party once ever.  In 2005 I got a ps2 for my birthday and 2007 I got a birthday party.  I can understand and all since I am a adult now as to why I never get presents it's just kind of depressing in a way cause it's like \"enjoy watching other people get the thing you only once experienced\".\r\n\r\nThat isn't to say I don't give gifts, I gave my nieces and nephews presents worth well over $150 last year and have given people crap tons of gifts(I don't ever tell them how much they're worth so they don't feel bad about not getting me anything and don't make them feel obligated to get me anything in return), but I don't know cause though I'm super non-materialistic it's kind of sad in a way.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"547d895f6368720f98e60100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Really internet?

Well people have been calling them out on it and going, \"you're advocating killing people on their gender identity, their race and their sex?  How is that not sexist and racist?\" to which the response to people questioning them was \"help I'm being harassed\" and then they coined the term \"sea-lioning\".\r\n\r\nIt literally means: \"to question someone in a civil manner *is* harassment\".\r\n\r\nTl:dr; apparently calling someone out on racist ideologies is now harassment.\r\n\r\nTl:dr of tl:dr; racists are stupid.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"547de593636872679ed20100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Miyo\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/547de3936368724b5d460300#post_547de3936368724b5d460300\r\nThere's just too much to point out in those pictures that I don't know what to focus on","author":"9ba2e84e636164642cc03200"}]}
