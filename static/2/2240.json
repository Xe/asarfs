It's been thirteen fucking years since 9/11 and they finally fucking admit they can't stop lone wolf attacks.  I'm actually kind of shocked here cause the entire department has for years gone, \"we can stop terrorist attacks without any evidence that we're effective at it and without any actual evidence that we have stopped any attacks and ignoring attacks like the boston bombing\" and they're just now admitting they can't stop lone wolf attacks.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"546b450f6368720576450000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/546b370063687224c81c0200#post_546b370063687224c81c0200\r\n\r\nAre they expecting a fucking medal for that?
