(And I don't usually use this term but they also have gotten pretty offensive with them too, like their jokes were already offensive but now they are just straight up bad) \r\n\r\nAt first you laugh, but after a while you start to realize the show is literally about a abusive family.\r\n\r\nPeter has assaulted his wife, he hates his Daughter, He encourages bad influences to his son, and he neglects his Baby. Like I know its a cartoon but holy crap its a common thing in this show now. ESPECIALLY Meg being a punching Bag which is horrible. \r\n\r\nMy mom said this once, why is it almost all the guys in Family guy are mindless assholes and or super stupid? Fact the only one that wasn't an asshole was Clevelende and they got rid of him.
