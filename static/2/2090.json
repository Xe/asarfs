Not bad but not spectacular in any way. The use of psychic powers was interesting and the mystery of Psyren were compelling and the action scenes were well drawn and well paced. The characters  were by far the weakest part. It spent so much time focusing on the mystery and action that the characters felt kind of boring. Hell a few of the most important characters just disappear for like 50 chapters. So am I disappointed that I read it? No. Would I read it again? Probably not.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"5459a1a1636872053acf0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5459a0a263687238642c0200#post_5459a0a263687238642c0200\r\nI saw.\r\n\r\n[spoiler]You'd look even better in my bedroom.[/spoiler]","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"5459a1cf6368721e0db80100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"Why can't I hold all these Ramen?!\":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku5FnJjdg1Y","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"5459a20a63687245cc950000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"playing binding of isaac reborn\r\nfirst floor got quad shot\r\nthen i get orbiting tears\r\nbig field of tears","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"5459a24b6368727e39bd0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54599a96636872489b110200#post_54599a96636872489b110200\r\nay yo marc\r\n\r\nI sketched a picture of ya\r\n\r\n[spoiler]!http://anony.ws/i/2014/11/05/mariomarc001.jpg![/spoiler]","author":"5007bbdf7f123b112f00023a"},{"id":"5459a2526368724859630100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SeraphimDawn\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5459a1cf6368721e0db80100#post_5459a1cf6368721e0db80100\r\nYou rak disiprin","author":"52f0834d63687261cba90300"},{"id":"5459a2836368722f5a570000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"This freaking show\r\n\r\n[spoiler]Dipper: \"It's not like I lay awake at night thinking about her!\"\r\n\r\n*lays awake at night thinking about Wendy*[/spoiler]","author":"9ba2e84e636164642cc03200"},{"id":"5459a28f6368723f1d450000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@PaskaNaakka\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5459a24b6368727e39bd0100#post_5459a24b6368727e39bd0100\r\nomg","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"5459a2f6636872430e8b0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"man.\r\n\r\ni really cant stop listening to shabba\r\n\r\nbut i hate the song\r\n\r\nso much\r\n\r\nbut i love it\r\n\r\nanyone got those songs that you just hate, but cant stop listening to?","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"5459a39a6368725198310000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"so my big field of tears homes now\r\nholy crap","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"5459a4a96368722240840000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Alright.
