Let's say you have 4 slots and each has an 8gig stick which is the highest amount desktop RAM will go and thus have 32 GB. Instead of having to buy a CPU with quad channel memory and a board with 8 slots, is there a way you can add more RAM? I heard about a RAM expander card that can be used via pci but those are from way back and I din't think would work with a modern board or CPU plus it's only DDR which means even with 4 slots it's only a 4gig increase. I don't want to buy server RAM because it's expense and of course needs a server CPU and board to use it.[/bq]\r\nYou should have asked this in the computer general thread, but like you said server ram wouldn't work on your computer.  Also yes you can buy a RAM expander, but I don't think there is a DDR3 type ram expander.\r\n\r\nShort version: No","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5365c25b63687244781d0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5365c1786368724478070000#post_5365c1786368724478070000\r\nI didn't even know there was a thread for that.

I'd say the Varenikis should make a strong stance for the sake of their sovereignty. This conflict is just unnecessary.
