It offers you cute backdrops for your journal entries, \"stickers\" to paste onto your workpage, and \"magic spells\" that make certain things happen if you click on a word set. So naturally, something for the kiddies. But something about it interested me so much that I ended up actually buying it, and since then, I've been writing nonstop for the first time since I was a kid. This shitty fourth grade-level app actually rekindled a flame within my soul.\r\n\r\nHow about that.","author":"5041b54f7f123b77af00a442"},{"id":"546f9cb26368721b13620200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@And Brother I Hurt People\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/546f9c766368726b09070000#post_546f9c766368726b09070000\r\nDaww\r\n\r\nThat's kinda sweet and stuff","author":"9ba2e84e636164642cc03200"},{"id":"546f9d2d63687229a8780000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I've just started the Ruby remake","author":"51a2815b7f123be59500049b"},{"id":"546f9d836368726481a20200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I know this ain't the Smash thread but the room is now open for anyone who doesn't have the Wii U version.","author":"515ddf93a4c72d8a1f000d57"},{"id":"546f9ee763687278bb320000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Man my Sam game is way off.","author":"515ddf93a4c72d8a1f000d57"},{"id":"546f9eec6368720423570000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@ParagonCommander\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/546f9d836368726481a20200#post_546f9d836368726481a20200\r\nWas that part of the patch?
