They are only militarty equipment. You can substitute them with tanks, choppers, etc. and the story would remain unaffected.\r\n\r\n-Evangelion: Same as CG; It dwells more about the pshycological effects and pressure of teenagers with traumatic backstories when faced against monsters that have the purpose of bringing the apocalypse and how they react to it, using the mechas as vehicles for those reactions.\r\n\r\n-Gurren Laggan: If anything, Gurren Laggan should give you an idea about how the rest of those mecha series would be. GL is a _homage_, it's not meant to encompass everything great from the genre, just the stuff that must diehard fans will recognize and in enough dosis that newcomers can get into, and then get into other series if they feel like it.\r\n\r\nI smell 4chan shenanigans.","author":null},{"id":"5373eaa9636872263ee80100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Background Pony #C7EB\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5373ea2d63687224e9730100#post_5373ea2d63687224e9730100\r\nIt is from 4chan (Also Hiding behind an Anon banner is a cowards way out, If you're always an anon, Then I apologize)","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"5373f48e63687268cf500200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"why isnt there any mlp/jerma and star crossovers\r\n\r\nseriously the only video i could find about that was \"this\":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcDpcwMEEQo ","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"5373f50c63687268cf5b0300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I just took the greatest nap ever.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"5373fc2b6368724a8b460200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5373f50c63687268cf5b0300#post_5373f50c63687268cf5b0300\r\n\r\nMe too...
