Dinosaurs were present in cages and tons of hot, young, nude women were present, ready to service the half-dinosaur half-teenager at any time. They proceeded to have a massive orgy, ending with the pregnancies of Twilight Sparkle, Princess Cadance, a stripper named May Florensis, and Hitomi Tanaka. They gave birth to dinosaur eggs which hatched into baby raptors. Randomosaur then agreed to help them take over the universe. After giving Vladimir Putin a handjob, he began building a giant weapon.

Bald Eagle!  Football!\" sense, but rather the \"Wow we've managed to survive for this long?\" sense.  What I mean by this is when you think about it if the usa was a person it would be one of those kind of slow people that honestly wants to help, but keeps fucking up.  \"Good lord usa!  Can you try not to fuck up for ten seconds?\"  \"I'm sorry guys; I don't know why this happened\"  \"Again usa?  Can you at least try to not to fuck up?\"  \"Sorry guys\"\r\n\r\nWhat I mean by this is current day stuff includes our terrible health care, our education system needs serious help, wiretapping, unemployment, our deficit and a million other things.  *BUT* you know what?  It's not actually as much of a doomsday scenario as it seems.  When you get right down to it most of our problems on the macro scale are cause we're a oligarchy and controlled by a bunch of greedy old people that don't understand why throwing money at something doesn't make people believe them.\r\n\r\nWhat I mean by this let's look at usa beliefs; most americans view themselves as conservative, but if you look at what people actually believe we're more center-progressive.  What I mean by this is the super majority of usa citizens are pro-freedom of speech, pro-freedom of religion, separation of church and state, want less strict copyright and trademark laws, pro glbt rights, pro womens' rights, pro minorities rights, anti-racism, anti-sexism, anti-homophobic, want reform for wiretapping, more and more people are using condoms, it's becoming more and more acceptable to be outside the norm, against the censorship of porn, for funding of nasa, pro education, is for the legalization of cannabas, pro vaccination, more and more people are supporting military isolationism.\r\n\r\nThe only three *BIG* things we're really \"conservative\" about are 50/50 of people are on the fence when it comes to abortion, only 63% of americans believe in climate change and somewhere around only 60% of americans believe in evolution.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you get right down to it I'll totally admit the usa is lagging behind europe and such when it comes to a lot of things, but you know what?  It's actually kind of a good thing really.  When the majority of europe legalized gay marriage the rest of the world just wrote it off as \"Those europeans and their crazy beliefs\", but when the usa started supporting glbt rights as a whole the world freaked the fuck out going \"Gay agenda out to destroy the world!\" and so forth.\r\n\r\nYeah I'll totally admit the usa is kind of in the shitter, but the thing to keep in mind is right now the reason why we're in the shitter is cause of a bunch of rich people constantly throwing money at politicians to get whatever agenda they want instead of what the american people want through congress.\r\n\r\n\r\nDespite it all I can't really hate the usa, cause all the people trying to hold us back as a country are all for the most part really friggin old and they're all probably going to die out of old age in a couple years anyhow (COUGHING INTENSIFIES) Koch brothers (COUGHING INTENSIFIES)\r\n\r\nTl:dr; The majority of people responsible for putting the usa in the shithole are really old and will have died of old age within a decade or two.\r\n\r\nIn other words:\r\nLobbyists in usa in a nutshell have\r\n!http://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3/f/f3/Death_streak_martyrdom.png!","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"536df4da63687222c86e0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"A few years ago, I use to watch porn a lot until I grew tired of it.\r\nIt was... weird, to say at least.\r\n\r\nImagine watching porn and not feeling that...","author":"4fe1b9f47f123b13df002976"},{"id":"536e11c76368721345fc0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@HJSDGCE\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/536df4da63687222c86e0200#post_536df4da63687222c86e0200\r\nThat's been me for the longest time.
