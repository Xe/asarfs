He started off a video by saying something like \"true equality is, if a woman can hit a man, a man should be able to hit right back\". Nobody bothered to look at his actual Tumblr page (even though it was _linked in the post that was complaining about him_), which states this:\r\n\r\n\"I was in an abusive relationship. Whenever my ex-girlfriend and I got into an argument, which was often, it eventually led to me being slapped or punched. The physical damage was nothing compared to the emotional toll, but not one time did I ever strike back because that’s not the kind of person I wanted to be. I don’t want anyone, regardless of gender, to have to go through that.\r\n\r\nA lot of people are making a great many assumptions without proper context but all of that aside I’m more disheartened that people would actually believe that I would perpetuate violence against women. Violence is a problem. Jack and I were not making some grand sweeping statement about feminism or trying to say that it’s okay to hit women. We were shooting the breeze talking about some crazy videos we saw on YouTube. The main point that some people missed out on is that it’s not okay to hit ANYONE. \r\n\r\nEquality is an ideal. But ideals taken in the literal sense don’t fit the world as it exists today. *An eye-for-an-eye is literal equality. Men and women being able to hit one-another is literal equality. There is a SERIOUS imbalance to that particular equation that needs to be solved but as a whole it’s still not the kind of equality I fight for.* I fight for a world that eventually forgets what violence is. I would gladly lay down my life to change the world today so that when I’m long gone and forgotten someday there will be a generation that only remembers humanity’s violence and greed in history books and children’s tales.\r\n\r\nMy videos are only intended to make people smile and I’m sincerely sorry that this one in particular failed to do that. I’ll always hold myself to a higher standard and I hope that you all will too. And remember to keep smiling! :D\"\r\n\r\nNotice that bolded part.\r\n\r\nThis poor guy was letting off steam about his abusive relationship and Tumblr just cared that what he said sort of kind of sounded sexist.","author":"5041b54f7f123b77af00a442"},{"id":"548c45556368720ca08f0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@And Brother I Hurt People\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/548c448b6368720e167f0000#post_548c448b6368720e167f0000\r\nProbably?\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of Tumblr pages like that I think though so even so there are lots of others too.
