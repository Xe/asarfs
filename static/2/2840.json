Togashi spends an entire TWENTY CHAPTERS dedicated to Gon and Killua preparing to buy a video game at an auction. TWENTY FREAKING CHAPTERS about the ins and outs of bidding, knowing when to bid, when not to bid, how much to bid, and the like And when the time comes for the pay-off for the arc, they just buy the game. In ONE CHAPTER! Twenty chapters of build-up for one of the worst finishes I've ever read in a manga.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"549b28a46368726e116b0e00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I seriously forgot how much I loved Nichijou","author":"9ba2e84e636164642cc03200"},{"id":"549b2b5f6368720616730e00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/846/528/60e.png!","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"549b2b826368722464300300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@EHAN\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/549b28a46368726e116b0e00#post_549b28a46368726e116b0e00\r\n[spoiler]You woudn't know judging by how much you go on about it.[/spoiler]","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"549b2bd0636872579cad0300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--hSUSSa1Y--/bbwdsbwn1kigucmn6tqb.jpg!\r\nHnng\r\nHnnnnng\r\nHNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNG","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"549b2c216368721de56c0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Carcass Strife\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/549b2bd0636872579cad0300#post_549b2bd0636872579cad0300\r\n[spoiler]I have underestimated how Popular Armored trooper VOTOMS the FPS is.[/spoiler]","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"549b2cd7636872407b8e0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/549b2c216368721de56c0200#post_549b2c216368721de56c0200\r\nWhich FPS.","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"549b2d7a6368726e110a0f00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/549b27ca6368724559d80700#post_549b27ca6368724559d80700\r\nThat's what it makes it interesting.
