Probably the most common one is that it promotes an unhealthy, exploitative view towards women and therefore promotes rape and abuse. Statistically speaking there is no backing up this view (at least that I am aware of), but it does fit an easy emotional narrative.\r\n\r\nThen there is the argument that the pornography industry itself (mean filmed porn of real people) is exploitative and corrupt. There is more to this one as historically speaking the adult film industry has been guilty of some nasty, unpleasant shit and even now it is not a great long term career option for the actors and actresses who hump on camera for our amusement. This to me does not seem like a good argument against porn so much as it seems like an argument for making the adult film industry a better place for those who work in it.","author":"4f41ee04945b701c41002af7"},{"id":"548b4f6f6368724950390500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://share.gifyoutube.com/yXXEaL.gif!","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"548b4fb26368724c8e620300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://i.imgur.com/dxqWOK4.jpg!","author":"9ba2e84e636164642cc03200"},{"id":"548b505d636872400c590000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"So guys.
