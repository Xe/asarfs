It's probably why they never tried to make a half-life 1 remake cause they knew they couldn't possibly live up to the hype.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo use a analogy think of it as like how the brony fandom has been slowly stagnating the last couple years after season 2; after season 2 everyone had such massive hype for the next season that anything that was less than perfect couldn't live up in their eyes.  Eventually hype reaches the point where a company can't live up to it cause fans think that anything that isn't shakespeare that can last for centuries popularity wise is \"t3h worstest thing evah!\"\r\n\r\nAnother analogy is like how we were talking about digimon last night.  After Tamers everyone had such massive hype for the next season that frontier had no chance cause in their eyes anything less than perfection was utter shit.\r\n\r\nOr like Touhou; the fandom is slowly stagnating cause after Subterranean Animism(11'th game) anything that wasn't perfect was utter shit in their eyes.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54764beb6368720a30420100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@PaskaNaakka\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54762e0d6368721083dd0000#post_54762e0d6368721083dd0000\r\nI do too.
