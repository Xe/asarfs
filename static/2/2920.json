It's probably why republicans are trying super hard to destroy his approval rating because once a president leaves office their approval rating shoots up.\r\n\r\nBasically in 2025 the top three presidents by popularity are going to be 1)Abraham 2)JFK 3)Obama\r\n\r\nI'm meh about him, but I do have to give him credit where it's due: he is extremely damn good at keeping his approval rating up over time.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54a2374c6368720c024e0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Carcass Strife\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a237126368722354970000#post_54a237126368722354970000\r\nYes.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54a2379c6368725dff672f00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a2371b636872773bdd0a00#post_54a2371b636872773bdd0a00\r\nMmmkay.\r\n*Clearly don't care about those stuffs*","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"54a237f363687232abe40b00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!https://38.media.tumblr.com/fb6826b4337c7a432d8aa99d83a3f331/tumblr_nhdnk0mQrj1qdlh1io1_250.gif!","author":"5239db6da4c72d22d9000358"},{"id":"54a238026368720f3cc40200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Carcass Strife\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a2379c6368725dff672f00#post_54a2379c6368725dff672f00\r\nTl:dr; Obama is shaping up to be to democrats as Reagan is to Republicans.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54a2386063687227ee880000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a238026368720f3cc40200#post_54a238026368720f3cc40200\r\nI haven't learnt much about presidents, so you're not being clear.\r\n*Duct tape your mouth*\r\nNow shush.","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"54a238806368725ebbc33100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Shadow the Hedgehog\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a237f363687232abe40b00#post_54a237f363687232abe40b00\r\nDrifting cars into explosives be like.","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"54a239766368726294921b00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"[spoiler]Didn't Birdon Kill Zoffy and Taro with One Peck?[/spoiler]","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"54a23a1f63687234d6da0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Carcass Strife\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a2386063687227ee880000#post_54a2386063687227ee880000\r\n[bq=\"Carcass Strife\"]\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a238026368720f3cc40200#post_54a238026368720f3cc40200\r\nI haven't learnt much about presidents, so you're not being clear.\r\n*Duct tape your mouth*\r\nNow shush.[/bq]\r\nShort version is that chances are that the USA will never have a caucasian male president again.  The next president is going to be Hillary; the next president is probably going to be a minority because Hillary and Obama's potentially approval ratings upon leaving office will be high enough that both parties will have candidates that are women or minorities as a means of getting the vote; by the time the president after Hillary leaves office caucasians will be the minority in the USA.\r\n\r\nTl:dr cause I know I'm annoying you; the USA will never have another caucasian straight male president.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54a23a906368727669910900","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a23a1f63687234d6da0200#post_54a23a1f63687234d6da0200\r\n\r\nThat sounds unlikely.
