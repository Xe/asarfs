It's like tying someone's hands together and then putting a pint icecream on their head; irrationally trying to immediately move to get the dessert will just wind up with a mess on the floor.\r\n\r\nIt's why I'm not materialistic; I've experienced first hand what blind desire does.  There is nothing wrong with desire so long as you think about it rationally, but the second you stop thinking with your brain everything makes a mess on the floor.\r\n\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5369a4396368726626cf0000#post_5369a4396368726626cf0000\r\n[bq=\"SquiggyBomb\"]\"@Randomosaur\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5369a3a063687247aff20000#post_5369a3a063687247aff20000\r\nAhhh the cruel hand of fate.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd irony.[/bq]\r\nMore like stupidity causes stupid decisions.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5369a51b6368721641100000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Randomosaur\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5369a3a063687247aff20000#post_5369a3a063687247aff20000\r\nNot that shocking really. Rich people are good at staying rich but ordinary jack offs don't really have any idea what to do with millions and millions of dollars. Not to mention that when your name gets in the paper or whatever for winning it I imagine that you get people wanting a handout or looking to otherwise get their hands on that sweet, sweet money just coming out of the woodwork.","author":"4f41ee04945b701c41002af7"},{"id":"5369a5b66368721c6a370000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@gasmaskangel\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5369a51b6368721641100000#post_5369a51b6368721641100000\r\nActually I have to correct something here.  Rich people aren't actually for the most part good at staying rich; rather they're rich because they're rich.  Being rich lets you to become even more rich.  The problem with that is often times this isn't thought through and often times when a recession or depression hits they throw themselves off buildings cause they don't know how to emotionally handle it.  During the great depression hundreds of bankers were throwing themselves off buildings.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5369a5d763687215fd770000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I'm just going to say that if anyone tries to start shit\r\n\r\n!http://i522.photobucket.com/albums/w341/DragonboyGT/1361250440937_zps8ed91ce6.jpg!\r\nI've brought my friend for a reason (And the controller of Course)","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"5369a6a063687215fdc90000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5369a5d763687215fd770000#post_5369a5d763687215fd770000\r\nI wasn't starting shit; rather I was bringing up how a common misconception is wrong.\r\n\r\nTo put it bluntly:  When a recession hits bankers and millionaires have epidemic cases of suicide due to they never could foresee such a thing happening to them.
