Those 5 months have been the most gruesome ones yet but I'm confident to say that I might get good grades and probably go to college overseas. I need to get straight As if I want to get a scholarship and go to prestigious universities in Japan. I was thinking either Ritsumeikan or Yokohama. I also plan to learn Japanese at a nearby university before I go there.\r\n\r\nCurrently, I'm thinking of my future plans. I'm interested in either aerospace engineering, telecommunications or petroleum engineering. I might choose Digital Animation with Game Development if I decided not to choose the other three.\r\n\r\nSo, what do you guys think?
