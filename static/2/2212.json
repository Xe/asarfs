The thing about Bleach is Kubo doesn't know how to write. He has the POTENTIAL to be a good writer but he has no idea what character development or pacing is. And his artwork is really lacking. To be fair his character designs are godlike but with things like panel layout and backgrounds he gets sooooooo lazy.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54684fe1636872564fee0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54684f3f63687279c31b0000#post_54684f3f63687279c31b0000\r\n\r\nIt was all good, then Soul Society ended and seems he's been trying to make that lightning strike twice ~It brings some sour memories to another series the more I think about it...~\r\n\r\nWe will never forget \"The Heart\".","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"546850ad6368727277e40000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@QuasarNova\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54684fe1636872564fee0100#post_54684fe1636872564fee0100\r\nKubo relies on a very paticular narrative crutch. When he doesn't know how to progress the story forward he does a very VERY bad thing. He introduces more characters. The problem with that is when you have so many characters you don't have the time needed to develop them properly. So they inevitably end up with little to no personality. He also uses waaaaaaaaay too many two-page spreads.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"546851246368725999520000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@QuasarNova\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54684dcd6368727e22540100#post_54684dcd6368727e22540100\r\nWhich is why I added the addendum, \"When phrased properly.\" When phrased _improperly_, it makes the writer look like a dumbass.","author":"5043cdb47f123b72cc0032d3"},{"id":"5468516e6368721200be0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Filipino is great when making someone talk foreign.
