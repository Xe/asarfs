You see, I was on this thread, not wasting my time at all and I decided to visit the front page one last time before I went to bed. I noticed somebody uploaded a new pic of Lilith, which I thought was odd, because every time somebody does upload a new pic of Lilith, I am conveniently on the front page. I decided save the picture on my Nexus, then I closed the page, got a glass of water, and went to bed. This morning, when I turned on my Nexus, I noticed it wouldn't stop reminding me that I saved the picture. I kept swiping the notification away, but it kept coming back. Hell, I turned on Pandora, and thankfully the notification didn't come back, or so I thought. You see, right when the song,\"Never Gonna Let You Go,\" started playing, the notification came back, and it wouldn't let me swipe the notification away until the song finished.\r\nCreepy stuff if you'd ask me.","author":"543c4f1b6368722b48c00100"},{"id":"547f1ea16368726ebfd50300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@xWoofyhoundx\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/547f1de16368721f92a10200#post_547f1de16368721f92a10200\r\n\"In an alternate universe, you are your waifus waifu.
