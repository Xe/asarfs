Most other industries when things get bad they freak out and ramp up production even though that makes things even worse.  If they were acting like other industries then right about now they would have been instead ramping up production to insanity levels and causing their own collapse.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"545580d06368723ac92d0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54557cb763687203efaa0000#post_54557cb763687203efaa0000\r\nDo you suspect that this was part of the Liberals' plan to make the Gun manufacturers crash like this?

For the past couple decades there's been paranoia about guns on both sides; that school shooting didn't cause the paranoia, but rather it was the trigger for a massive paranoia freakout that caused the house of cards to come down.  It wasn't liberals or conservatives that caused all this, rather all they really did was ramp up all in society until something had to snap.  The school shooting was the thing that made society snap.\r\n\r\nTo use a analogy it's like the ebola scare going on; I really wish politicians would stop trying to scare people about it cause eventually if they keep driving up the paranoia and keep driving up the paranoia eventually society's just going to snap and have a panic attack.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54558a4a6368723e36f60000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Twisty\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5455851863687250ed0e0100#post_5455851863687250ed0e0100\r\nDon't fuck with male lions.\r\n\r\n\"Lion vs Tiger\":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tt_ROaAQS-8\r\nSupposedly, both cats are just as strong as each other.

After 9/11 the usa went to two wars; drove the paranoia home for over a decade to the point you can't even carry water on a plane, constantly driving this idea of \"you're going to die cause of terrorism\" and such, *BUT* after the boston bombing everyone just went, \"yeah; terrorism, just another part of life\".\r\n\r\nIt's kind of hilarious in a way cause for a decade one of the main driving forces against internet security was this idea of \"if you promote internet security you're helping terrorists\" and with wikileaks no one is buying that anymore.  The reason why it's so hilarious is that no one is buying that crap anymore to such a extent that the fbi is trying to say that promoting internet security is protecting pedophiles. . . . I'm not joking either.  If you're wondering what I mean by this is 2001 to 2013, \"Oh my god if your internet is secure then terrorists might be able to attack america!\"; 2014, \"no matter what there will be terrorist attacks so is the scare really justified?\", fbi \"crap, better come up with a new societal scare then. . . I know; 'everyone if you promote internet security pedophiles will take over society'\"; everyone else, \"you're seriously that desperate? seriously?\"\r\n\r\nTl:dr; the more people drive home paranoia the less and less effective it is.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54558df86368723808920100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54558dd8636872671e410000#post_54558dd8636872671e410000\r\nAdding Too_Offensive on my Wii U friends list.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54558e176368721e09b10000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54558dd8636872671e410000#post_54558dd8636872671e410000\r\n\r\nwe are posting really fucked up porn in a tinychat","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"54558e95636872055bbd0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SeraphimDawn\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/545580d06368723ac92d0100#post_545580d06368723ac92d0100\r\nno.\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_violence_in_the_United_States_by_state","author":"4fe16df67f123b13e400003f"},{"id":"54558ede6368725ac10e0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54558df86368723808920100#post_54558df86368723808920100\r\nOoh ooh\r\nEveryone add me to their wii u friends if you have\r\nIt's mariomarc on there","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"54558f466368721ed1fe0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!i.imgur.com/KSJ4fsO.jpg!\r\n[spoiler]Yohohohohohohohohoho~[/spoiler]","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54558f686368723aeb3d0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://i1.wp.com/www.cringechannel.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/10665241_835504416493919_8003647282753423022_n.jpg?resize=640%252C990!","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"54558f946368725773250200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I'm so bored I'm watching my snake shed","author":"51a2815b7f123be59500049b"},{"id":"54558fa96368723e62b00000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Twisty\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54558f686368723aeb3d0000#post_54558f686368723aeb3d0000\r\nDoritopope approved:\r\n!http://i2.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/015/589/Naamloos-2.png!","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5455902b63687206e6150000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SidewardManatee\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54558f946368725773250200#post_54558f946368725773250200\r\nI've always loved snakes.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"545590756368725773410200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"[spoiler]I'm back from watching the Agito movie.[/spoiler]","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"5455908e636872778e210000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5455902b63687206e6150000#post_5455902b63687206e6150000\r\nYeah\r\nThey are pretty cool.\r\n[spoiler]better then fish or bugs[/spoiler]","author":"51a2815b7f123be59500049b"},{"id":"54559156636872062e660200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Twisty\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54558f686368723aeb3d0000#post_54558f686368723aeb3d0000\r\n...
