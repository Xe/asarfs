[/bq]\r\nIt's more than likely going to be something in that ballpark cause all the advancements in AI lately have been in the field where it mimics the human brain.  I'll totally admit that advancements into AI have hit a huge snag, but that's the traditional type of AI that everyone thinks of when they think of terminator or such.\r\n\r\nBasically the type of AI that is making massive leaps and bounds lately is the type where it's essentially a human mind inside a computer instead.  The singularity(theoretical point at which we do have sapient AI) is coming quicker than we thought it would; basically ten years ago the predictions into when was 2050, but now it's looking more like 2030.  There's still plenty of people that say it's not ever going to happen/it won't happen for a century, but the field where the AI is basically a human mind inside a computer is making a insane amount of progress.\r\n\r\nIn 2010 we could barely simulate a thousand neurons, now we can simulate a million.\r\n\r\nTl:dr; Terminator will never happen cause the field of AI that is making progress is completely different.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54866dd363687253d4690300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54866b226368723e1aa30300#post_54866b226368723e1aa30300\r\nI would watch that show.","author":"4f41ee04945b701c41002af7"},{"id":"54866ea363687222a29e0300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54866d8c6368720a3cf70200#post_54866d8c6368720a3cf70200\r\ni hope that long distance travel gets cheaper","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"54866ecb63687215a52e0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54866d8c6368720a3cf70200#post_54866d8c6368720a3cf70200\r\nBut wouldn't there also be a possibility that humans who become more \"mechanically enhanced\" to level the playing fields?","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"54866f086368723242d50100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"i just noticed something\r\n\r\ncalliope's online handle is:uranianUmbra\r\nand callibornÂ´s handle is:undyingUmbrage\r\n\r\ncalliope only capitalises the letter U, while caliborn uses uppercase letters except for the u\r\n\r\nUU and uu\r\n\r\nso unless my cheap bilogy classes failed me, isnt UU and uu part of the RNA genetic pattern?\r\n\r\nsomething like UU being dominant while uu is recessive?","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"54866f3463687218ad1b0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Twisty\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54866f086368723242d50100#post_54866f086368723242d50100\r\n~neeeeeeeerd~","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"54866f6563687207e2150400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20140216065945/ultra/images/6/6e/King_Joe_WOWOW_II.png!\r\nBest Robot.","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"54866fe563687232f5610600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54866f3463687218ad1b0200#post_54866f3463687218ad1b0200\r\n\r\nur just mad cause i finally put biology classes to good use","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"5486703263687219c9580200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Twisty\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54866fe563687232f5610600#post_54866fe563687232f5610600\r\n~i am actually jealous of smart people being smarter then me~","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"548670436368725a489b0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SeraphimDawn\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54866ecb63687215a52e0200#post_54866ecb63687215a52e0200\r\nObviously.\r\n\r\nThe main problem that was impeding cybernetics was that we couldn't directly link machines to the nervous system and those impulses have any real meaning between the two and now they're overcoming it.\r\n\r\nSomething like ghost in the shell will happen in the next ten to fifteen years, *BUT* the next main problem being occurred is directly linking the human brain's processing information directly with a computer and replacing organs entirely.
