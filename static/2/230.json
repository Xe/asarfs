Take all the paperwork you no longer need, all the physical evidence, go out in the desert and burn it all.  If there is no longer any physical evidence then it doesn't matter who spills their guts they're just going to be viewed as crackpots.  Any data information keep them on separate networks and whenever they're no longer needed purge the information and when the computer is outdated and replaced take it out to the desert and melt it as well.  That way no matter how damning the information is or whoever spills their guts it's still going to forever remain in the realm of crackpot conspiracy theories.  At that point having people spill their guts would actually help keep the secret cause if there's a million people going around claiming that we never landed on the moon or such regardless of whether or not it's true they're forever just going to be labelled as crackpot conspiracy theorists.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53698f0a6368723803d00200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"The people of Hong Kong are annoyed to say the least.\r\nMainland Chinese visit, and defecate in the street.

My plan is to first two semesters have a part time job to pay off the dentist bill before the interest rate gets too high, then reduce the hours so as to have money for moving and first couple months rent when I do graduate.  This is one of those cases where not having many possessions is better financially because me moving across country would only cost a couple hundred dollars.  This in turn will allow me enough time to finish my project thus giving me more money in the end and more than likely have a job waiting for me by the time I graduate again.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5369982563687227d9650100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I will eat this GMO soybean to prove that it is safe.\r\n\r\n*Eats soybean*\r\n\r\nSee?
