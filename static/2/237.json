So much this.\r\n\r\nGail Simone's Wonder Woman books are some of my favorite comics. One of them involved her chucking a flaming helicopter at the fuck mothering DEVIL and then decapitating him with the invisible jet. It was the single most metal thing I've ever seen in any comic book.\r\n\r\nToo bad her comics in New 52 are goddamn garbage.\r\n\r\nI'm actually pretty disgusted with DC as a whole these days. The only New 52 books I follow are Animal Man and Swamp Thing.\r\n\r\nAre there any Marvel books worth getting into right now? I follow Deadpool off and on already.","author":"4f41ee04945b701c41002af7"},{"id":"536bffba63687234f1290100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/536bfdc9636872329d8a0000#post_536bfdc9636872329d8a0000\r\n!http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/679/004/c8b.jpg!","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"536bffc963687233e92c0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Check the religion thread GMA, I have some new fundie quotes.","author":"50b70eeb7f123b1a02000097"},{"id":"536c00bb63687235ef6b0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"Here's another robot anime that you likely haven't heard of\":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLS6fDIS5iQ\r\n\r\nBlue Blue~ Blue Fixer~","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"536c01976368723568c30100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/536c00bb63687235ef6b0100#post_536c00bb63687235ef6b0100\r\n\r\nLol, they have a tank that flies.","author":"31bee2686368722a0df23600"},{"id":"536c044b636872329d730300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Gizoid101\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/536c01976368723568c30100#post_536c01976368723568c30100\r\nYou're welcome.\r\nCarlos.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDear diary next time a otaku asks me, \"Can you tell me what this 'anime' is about?\" I'm just going to show this instead:\r\n!http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/154/139/3z0mR.gif!\r\nAnd then walk away.
