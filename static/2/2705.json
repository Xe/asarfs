I'm sure of it. Just like they did against the Steelers in the 2008-2009 season.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Steelers are also a team I really like, so I really didn't care who won that Super Bowl.\r\n\r\nI just hope they make it to the Super Bowl, because if I'm not mistaken, it'll be the first time a team makes it to the Super Bowl when it's being held in their own stadium.","author":"9ba2e84e636164642cc03200"},{"id":"548f42b06368725baf230300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/548f3f7963687233870a0100#post_548f3f7963687233870a0100\r\nAnd nobody knows the purpouse of that incident?

Standalone attacks are impossible to prevent due to they are not part of a organization but motivated by their beliefs and such.  The people that go, \"well why don't we <x> to prevent standalone attacks\" are complete and utter fucking morons because attacks like these are impossible to prevent.\r\n\r\nAs time goes on we'll see less large scale attacks like 9/11, the boston bombing or such and instead more attacks like these because they are without a doubt 100% impossible to prevent.  The only way anyone could possible prevent standalone attacks is if we imprisoned everyone from birth to death for the sake of their \"safety\" and even then chances are we would still have terrorist attacks by standalone individuals of individuals that would hypothetically be there for people's \"safety\".\r\n\r\nIf you want to know what I mean by standalones watch Ghost in the Shell season 1; it's a good summary into how standalones come into existence and are motivated by ideals rather than being a part of a organization or such.\r\n\r\nPretty much attacks like these are impossible to prevent and anyone in the news or mass media who claims they are preventable are pants on head slang definition of retarded.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"548f444f6368723d87620100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hBITjBR_yac/T-BJd5G6iDI/AAAAAAAACtc/1rAh9UwhSm0/s400/xor_gavan3_800-600.jpg!\r\nLooking for Pics of Gavan from the original Gavan show and only finding pics of Gavan Type-G and Gavan as he was in Gokaiger.\r\n\r\n#Showatokufanproblems","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"548f44af63687237b6b50800","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"So my granddad has to get a [spoiler]colonoscopy.[/spoiler]\r\nI have to drive him.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"548f44de636872585bc00000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"Ok\":http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/subcultures/amiibo","author":"9ba2e84e636164642cc03200"},{"id":"548f45af6368724bd1e40900","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://www.xlrecordings.com/uploads/news/350.jpeg!","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"548f45ca6368721bbd370100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I also started watching A Certain Magical Index as a pallet clenser for Digimon.\r\nPLEASE tell me that Touma does more punching in this series.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"548f460363687239a8440000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Also, What TV executive in the 80s looked at Space sheriff Gavan and said \"No One's going to like this.\"?","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"548f460563687262fd7a0600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"So, I come back, see the last page.\r\nGuis.\r\nSthap.","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"548f465263687271c57d1900","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Carcass Strife\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/548f460563687262fd7a0600#post_548f460563687262fd7a0600\r\nBut football","author":"9ba2e84e636164642cc03200"},{"id":"548f465e63687272394b0d00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://thebomberjacket.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/wiki2-JACOBWAYLER.jpg!\r\n\r\nwiki from ratking.","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"548f46626368723b6b4f0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Carcass Strife\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/548f460563687262fd7a0600#post_548f460563687262fd7a0600\r\nNever.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"548f469763687208b3fa0d00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@EHAN\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/548f465263687271c57d1900#post_548f465263687271c57d1900\r\nI meant the previous page.\r\nMAKE IT ORGE, FOOL.
