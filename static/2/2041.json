Well essentially to summarize what is happening in the usa right now social conservatives are having a hard ass time getting re-elected right now cause yes republicans are going to take the senate by two or three seats, *BUT* the catch though is that a lot of politicians are having to drop the religious right to get re-elected.  They're still holding the conservative banner, but they're having to drop a lot of rhetoric to remain electable.\r\n\r\nWhat does this mean?  Well it's just a theory, *but* bye bye religious right movement in politics because your candidates either have to drop social conservatism or they're going to lose.\r\n\r\nTl:dr; libertarianism is subtly taking over the republican party cause the religious right's ideologies are no longer electable.\r\n\r\nIf you're still trying to understand what I mean by this is 2020 it's going to be democrats vs -republicans- libertarians.\r\n\r\nWhy am I excited even though I'm not a republican?  Cause bye bye anti-gay rights movement and bye bye religious right.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5455a43a63687250751f0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5455a3e563687267af360000#post_5455a3e563687267af360000\r\nGod dammit Monty...\r\n[spoiler]Those heels look good on him though.[/spoiler]","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"5455a43c6368725ab3930200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"The baby snake finished shedding ","author":"51a2815b7f123be59500049b"},{"id":"5455a483636872067e6e0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Twisty\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5455a27a6368722bcc4a0100#post_5455a27a6368722bcc4a0100\r\nI would probably just stand in the room awkwardly.
