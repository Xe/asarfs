He has the power over a specific element in the world and has an Elemental Spirit inside of him that guides him on using it. Elementals can be seen from their tails. Each Elemental has a different tail design. There are many Elemental in the world and they are placed in three categories.\r\n\r\n1st: Originals. (Water, Earth, Fire, Air)\r\n2nd: Hybrids. (Lightning, Ice, Swamp, Smoke, Iron, etc.)\r\n3rd: Specials. (Chaos, Flora, Gamma, Poison, etc.)\r\n\r\nRed is a Gamma Elemental and his abilities focus mainly on heat. He also has a cousin who is a Chaos Elemental. When an Elemental dies, they are resurrected in a newborn body who can access their past memories if they wish. Red has a fox tail.\r\n\r\nThe way I write the story is that I try my best to make Red extremely \"lucky\" and usually surviving many harsh events. But the thing is that I try to avoid revealing too much of Red's past so that people can speculate what and who he really is.  Red is clumsy and kind-hearted. He usually helps people and would always look at his opponents as an equal. He made a vow to never take a life again and would always try to avoid conversations that would enter his childhood.\r\n\r\nTruth is, Red had a terrible childhood. He was hated by an entire kingdom due to a crime he (probably) had commit, tortured every day and has many scars on his body, the largest would be his entire left arm which now looks like Zuko's face scar. He was saved by a scientist (who at first was only interested in his abilities but later cared of him) but was killed about 2 years afterwards. He stayed as an orphan until he was 17, where he would leave to become an Explorer. At that time, Red was a ruthless hired mercenary (but a still nice guy) and would usually kill his enemies quick and painless. After his best friend died in front of him, he vowed to never take a life ever again as he then knows that life is sacred. \r\n\r\nReply this if you want to know the crime Red was blamed on.","author":"4fe1b9f47f123b13df002976"},{"id":"548a5a306368725066890000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@HJSDGCE\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/548a599963687252f41f0000#post_548a599963687252f41f0000\r\nI am curious to know.","author":"4f41ee04945b701c41002af7"},{"id":"548a5a676368723ed0bc0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/548a58ff6368723a163c0000#post_548a58ff6368723a163c0000\r\n\r\n*you are suspended*\r\n\r\nreason: this is a christian site.","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"548a5aed6368724fd8b20000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Twisty\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/548a5a676368723ed0bc0000#post_548a5a676368723ed0bc0000\r\nOoh!
