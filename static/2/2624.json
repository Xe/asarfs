For example the difference between a \"normal\" person and a feral person is that feral people never learned how to identify themselves or anything and therefore behave on base instincts whereas feral people who are introduced into society slowly become normal individuals through education and such.\r\n\r\nIt's kind of fascinating when you think about it because \"I\" as in myself am a socially constructed type of thought whose purpose is to identify what is my self and build upon it to form a identity based upon perceived memories and so forth that may or may not have happened in actuality.  Furthermore \"we\" can't even prove that sapience is actually a physical thing, but yet here we are thoughts that are initially learned through social constructs identifying ourselves building off how our thoughts view our thoughts expanding upon it to observe the outside world beyond our mere thoughts so as to interact with the outside world and further experience things that ultimately effect how we identify ourselves and in turn changing who we are.\r\n\r\nTl:dr; \"I think therefore I am\"","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"548940ed6368722e466e0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/548940a7636872189a350000#post_548940a7636872189a350000\r\nYou just put into words the major theme of the Ghost in the Shell movie.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54894111636872721a9b0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/548940a7636872189a350000#post_548940a7636872189a350000\r\n\r\nSomeone wants the D","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"5489416d6368726d0a680200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/548940a7636872189a350000#post_548940a7636872189a350000\r\num\r\n\r\ni'll be honest i didn't understand a word of that","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"548941996368725768120300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@QuasarNova\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54894111636872721a9b0100#post_54894111636872721a9b0100\r\nme","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"548941ba63687215beed0300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/548941996368725768120300#post_548941996368725768120300\r\n\r\nThe Squiggy D","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"5489420c63687235aa020100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@QuasarNova\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/548941ba63687215beed0300#post_548941ba63687215beed0300\r\ni want all of that D","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"548942356368725dee230400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@QuasarNova\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/548941ba63687215beed0300#post_548941ba63687215beed0300\r\nMy penis sense is tingling...","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"548942526368720b41070500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/548942356368725dee230400#post_548942356368725dee230400\r\nis your penis itself also tingling?","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"548942576368727a0d820300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Butts ","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"54894259636872721af60100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Speaking of blowing someone's head\r\n\r\nHere's a less literal mind blower: AXL ROSE is an anagram of SNORLAX","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"5489428f6368727950b70200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/548942526368720b41070500#post_548942526368720b41070500\r\nA little.
