We're talking about instead of your everyday waves on the beach we're instead talking about your average beach wave being the size of skyscrapers.  The waves alone would take out 2/3 of the human race.  The earthquakes would be so immense and so common that everyday life on ground would be impossible.  The only way life would be possible is in giant air cities and resources would be limited so the human race would go down from 7.8 billion to only a couple ten thousand.
