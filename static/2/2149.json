You remember Postal 1? The game where you kill everyone for no reason after going postal? If you remember it, you will note that Hatred have a lot similitudes with Postal 1. \r\n\r\nWhat is really stupid are those persons who says this game \"crossed the line\" because you kill innocent people, and later say that they have played games like GTA, Postal, Saw, etc.[/bq]\r\n\r\nwell i guess that is a more accurate perception.\r\n\r\nyeah postal 1 was pretty much the same thing hatred did.\r\n\r\nbut there was a reason why they made postal 2 so different, because they felt adding such a superficial layer to a game like the shock value was too boring.\r\n\r\nalso, postal 1 had some actual erieness to it, like actual unsettling messages and music, kinda gave a bit more insanity from perspective, so unless hatred comes up with something like that then i guess i wont hold my hopes high.","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"545f083a63687207208b0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"He just told me that he has pills.","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"545f08e263687207209a0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"like hell, postal 1 is an incredibly creepy game now that i look back.","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"545f0a1f636872548b340200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/545f083a63687207208b0000#post_545f083a63687207208b0000\r\nAnd everything because a joke...\r\n\r\n\"@Twisty\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/545f08e263687207209a0000#post_545f08e263687207209a0000\r\nAnd very disturbing.
