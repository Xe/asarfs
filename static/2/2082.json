Oh well at least in the event we invade, we can create multi-class freaking combat mages, mix magic with guns, and whoop we can kick the crap out of almost anything. \r\n\r\nI'm still trying to figure out if a dragon would win against a fully armored tank though, a 120mm HEAT vs skin about as hard as tungsten...\r\nI dunno how'd that work out.
