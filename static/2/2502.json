There's a million generic mean internet celebrities, but very few nice honest internet celebrities who are genuinely nice.\r\n\r\nIt's why I don't watch as many let'splayers any more or such cause it's very rare to see someone as cool of a person as markiplier.\r\n\r\nI think eventually there will be a bust in video games let'splayers cause a lot of people on the internet are so used to this idea that being mean to people = views and markiplier shows that people are tired of that generic comedy stick; people like him because he's such a nice person and such and genuinely like him.\r\n\r\nHe's a nice person and he deserves those viewerships.  I normally use adblock all across the internet, but I actually allow ads on his videos because I want to support him so he can make a living off his stuff.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54813c5b6368727696d10000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"Viva La Clarity [Zedd feat.
