I was referred to one place that could do it.  I went in and heard music playing.  I went to get something to read and noticed a book of Mormon on the table.  Weird.  Then I realized the music was Christian rock.  That is when I decided to find another place, one I would feel more comfortable in.  Religion gets me riled up and I was going to be enough on edge from having to have the root canal.  Why didn't they just play the annoying pop radio stations like everyone else?  Do you suppose they were trying to proselytise?  Or maybe do they live in a bubble where everyone is Christian so they don't even consider that some people might not appreciate their Jesus tunes?
