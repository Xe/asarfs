However I've always found that the BLT is very much a slave to the quality of the ingredients, a single wilted leaf of lettuce or bacon cooked to anything other than crisp, crunchy perfection can utterly ruin the experience for me.","author":"4f41ee04945b701c41002af7"},{"id":"547a879a6368721be1a00200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/547a87606368725e3d4b0100#post_547a87606368725e3d4b0100\r\nThis man speaks truth.","author":"4f41ee04945b701c41002af7"},{"id":"547a87bd6368722469db0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I don't like turkey.","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"547a87df6368722469e60200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"i just don't feel like spending a lot of time on a sandwich","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"547a87e66368724de0b50200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@gasmaskangel\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/547a877363687253bb6f0200#post_547a877363687253bb6f0200\r\nSuch is the tragedy of the BLT.
