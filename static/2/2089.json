I know it's a controversial subject, but the subject was feminism; basically classical feminists are the good ones(like C H Sommers)(basically classical feminism stands for equality of both genders, anti-quotas, pro-freedom).  Third wave feminists are what you probably know as social justice warriors(towards women's supremacy, believes that if quotas aren't being met that women should be forced into a job even if she doesn't want it, anti-freedom).\r\n\r\nWell what I did was that you know how western society is moving towards the idea of people should be treated equally?  Classical feminism as a movement may be dead, but we've won because the vast majority of the populace believes that both genders should be treated the same.\r\n\r\nThis pissed the hell out of who I was talking to cause the person wanted men to literally be nothing more than cattle, no rights to vote, no freedoms or such under the belief that was \"equality\".  I gave a no bullshit stuck to factual information about the general populace's beliefs and such and they got angrier and angrier and angrier because they realized that their ideals were unpopular and their hopes for how they want the world to be would never come to existence.\r\n\r\nI'd be lying if I wasn't laughing my ass off at how angry they were getting.\r\n\r\n\r\nReason why I'm posting this in a nutshell:\r\nSometimes it's fun to poke the bear if the bear is on the other side of the bars.  Sometimes extremists are fun to make angry.\r\n\r\n\r\nTl:dr; well I had fun.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54599c586368722bdb690000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://edge-img.datpiff.com/m2cdc992/Wale_The_Mixtape_About_Nothing-front-large.jpg!","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"54599d746368722becf60100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@gasmaskangel\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54599aa663687255ea840100#post_54599aa663687255ea840100\r\nYou mean in the later episodes or you're gonna give me something?\r\n\r\nBecause I am already aware of the fact that the later episodes will amaze me.
