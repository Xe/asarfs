Also you would never have to worry about it getting dull because it's designed to be dull.  I believe the marine combat knife is actually designed to stab someone's brains cause they teach you the proper way to do it is to stab, twist to a 90 degree angle and then pull out so that the person has no chance of surviving.  Also they're light weight unlike swords.  There's no real combat reason for swords in the military because if you're that close to someone you're either dead or you need your knife.  There's a reason why militaries don't use swords anymore other than for decoration.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54a246aa6368725c84180700","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a242bf6368723e6e290d00#post_54a242bf6368723e6e290d00\r\nAmercuh","author":"513e68eda4c72d4e3b000164"},{"id":"54a246b06368720f3ca10300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@QuasarNova\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a2468d6368722354a30100#post_54a2468d6368722354a30100\r\nno\r\ni love you guys\r\n\r\nespecially squiggy-bear~","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"54a246c363687242ce180200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SeraphimDawn\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a2456a636872706e692100#post_54a2456a636872706e692100\r\n-Beaner-\r\nMejican","author":"5239db6da4c72d22d9000358"},{"id":"54a246c363687239d1472900","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a246056368725ac37d2b00#post_54a246056368725ac37d2b00\r\n...
