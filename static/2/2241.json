If there was another 9/11 the only reason why it couldn't happen again is that the air force now has orders to if a plane is hijacked by terrorists to shoot down the plane if they refuse to land.\r\n\r\nI would not be surprised if the nsa and such years down the line gets de-funded.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"546b72686368727e45400100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/546b6fbd6368724ff5350000#post_546b6fbd6368724ff5350000\r\n\r\nIt went pretty normal...
