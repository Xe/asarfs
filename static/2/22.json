You know, the kind that 99% of are utter shit. Like a Jack Chic book but in reverse. \r\n\r\nIf you ask me, a good idea would be to portray neither side as just pure evil, and both having legitimate points. (granted this is personal preference, but it seems stories that do that tend to be better)\r\n\r\n...Or go the route of Wanted and make everyone, and I mean EVERYONE, an unrepetent horrible fuck.","author":"500757fd7f123b75a90003b1"},{"id":"52f44c96636872443f750200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Princess♠Molestia\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/52f442a063687265f1990000#post_52f442a063687265f1990000\r\nI was wondering where you were","author":"4fe16df67f123b13e400003f"},{"id":"52f44ec86368721c61290000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Princess♠Molestia\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/52f442a063687265f1990000#post_52f442a063687265f1990000\r\nWhat about both?

I'm going to finish up what I'm doing then get started on it.\r\n\r\nThe only problem I'm seeing with it now is that it may be too short now.  The reason being is that I axed off four main characters and their story arcs cause of the feedback made me realize they would have seriously dragged it down.  It was originally going to be 120 pages, but now it's down to about 40.  Then again better to remove the bad characters than to have them drag it down.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"52f4586763687230ba650000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/52f33635636872272c8f0000#post_52f33635636872272c8f0000\r\nReligion and Nature vs Science.\r\nMy favourite type of science fiction sub-genre.","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"52f4a5916368722458ff0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"This song accurately describes the so-called sane fans.\":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAYL5H46QnQ","author":"50d9a3aea4c72dc9b3000120"},{"id":"52f519666368724106030100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Well hmm. . .
