I'm going to summarize a bit because I've already talked about it: social conservatives are having the hardest time getting elected/re-elected to the point a lot of politicians are having to tone down the rhetoric, the religious right is having troubles as well, republicans are probably going to take the senate by two seats because the party is dropping starting to drop social conservatism and a lot of other things to get elected.  Obviously the politicians aren't changing leafs, but rather they're having to tone down the tone on social conservatism.\r\n\r\nTl:dr; libertarians are taking over the republican party cause the religious right and social conservatives can't get elected anymore so republicans either have to drop social conservatism or lose election.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5455d3ab6368727e9e2e0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5455d11e6368727873a80100#post_5455d11e6368727873a80100\r\n[bq=\"trashboat\"]\"@gasmaskangel\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5455cfbe6368726426170100#post_5455cfbe6368726426170100\r\nHomestuck.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone else watch Vinesauce corruptions?[/bq]\r\n\r\nMe.\r\nNot all the time.
