My strong suite though is having things stick when it comes to knowledge.  A prime example of this is website development; even though I kind of got into it as a joke and learned java just to do something fancy a four years ago and haven't really used it since I still remember most of the bells and whistles.  In other words: Once I understand something it sticks even after years of not using that knowledge.  My intelligence is normal, rather I don't lose knowledge.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"536898046368727428580000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Background Pony #5B67\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5368973063687259e49b0000#post_5368973063687259e49b0000\r\nIt's moments like this that makes me Envy the mods (They can tell who it is if they click the post anonymously tab)\r\n\r\nThere's just something about Super robots that I just don't get out of Real robot shows","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"536898216368727ab6450000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@someguy111\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/536897a0636872748e130000#post_536897a0636872748e130000\r\nThere is no point debating you then.","author":"50b70eeb7f123b1a02000097"},{"id":"5368984763687268eab80000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Randomosaur\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/536898216368727ab6450000#post_536898216368727ab6450000\r\nVery well, discussion over.","author":"5010fa077f123b1e4f00104e"},{"id":"5368985b6368727d72440000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@someguy111\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/536897a0636872748e130000#post_536897a0636872748e130000\r\n\r\nThey put like 0,00000025 mercury in those things, thats less than what fish have.\r\n\r\nPlus its not pure, those chemicals have been treated to bee harmful, like how salt ingrediets have chemicals tht in pure form are used for poisons, but salt in moderation is harmless.","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"5368987b63687204523a0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/536897dd63687274283b0000#post_536897dd63687274283b0000\r\nYou call that normal Intelligence?

The reason why is that the last art contest I was in, even though I wasn't the best, the only people that won the contest were \"postmodern\" \"art\" pieces and hipsters went around being douchbags to the actual artists.  That wasn't the thing that hurt the most; rather all but one of the judges called the \"postmodern\" stuff good whereas the other stuff bad and handed out thousands of dollars to only the ones they liked.  I was so upset by this that I switched degrees and next to none of the original pieces remain.\r\n\r\nI was going to get back into drawing a week ago, but I'm in the process of moving and well that's been put on hold for another week.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"536899a56368720f3c830000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@twistedmetalero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5368991a636872541c4c0200#post_5368991a636872541c4c0200\r\nMaybe because on the internet there are so many people you feel as if the whole world is paying attention then as of in RL where it's just the few people you're talking too?","author":null},{"id":"53689a4063687209f62d0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Background Pony #5B67\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/536899a56368720f3c830000#post_536899a56368720f3c830000\r\n\r\nMaybe, but i also do care about lets say regulars i like, even if it is only 1.","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"53689a7c6368720e20f10000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5368998f6368721920340000#post_5368998f6368721920340000\r\nAwwww, that sucks.\r\n\r\nI bet your a wonderful artist! and whenever you get back to drawing I'd be delighted to see your work my good sir.","author":null}]}
