And I can guarantee they've most likely been drawing for much longer than that. Believe me- it takes time.","author":"5043cdb47f123b72cc0032d3"},{"id":"545c0a016368726591860100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Shadow the Hedgehog\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/545c08b36368725213fe0000#post_545c08b36368725213fe0000\r\n\r\nThat message still haunts players even to these days","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"545c0a0f63687237aec10100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/545c09886368727fa5910000#post_545c09886368727fa5910000\r\nPotato.","author":"5007bbdf7f123b112f00023a"},{"id":"545c0a426368723310290000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/545c09c56368721342460200#post_545c09c56368721342460200\r\nPretty good.\r\nGo back a page and read my Romantic Comedy pitch.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"545c0aa563687272658f0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Silent_Witness\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/545c09f36368726c76190200#post_545c09f36368726c76190200\r\nYeah...
