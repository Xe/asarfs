I like the artstyle cause you can tell it's definitely a very low budget show, but they make good use of their budget art wise and even though they don't have the budget for intense high action fight scenes they make use of their budget artistically.  He doesn't so much as \"defeat the evil <insert>\" so much as try to help them get used to it.  The first arc he helps a girl realize she wasn't cursed by god, but she actually wanted the curse.
