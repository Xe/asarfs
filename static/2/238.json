We don't actually know what was before our universe because anything that was before it the evidence for it is no longer in existence.\r\n\r\nWhen the universe was first created everything existed in a single point where all the matter and energy was created and all forces were once force, the universe started expanding due to entropy in that energy from a higher state will move to a lower state.  At the beginning all matter had a anti-matter pair, however for some reason most anti-matter is no longer around it has been theorized that anti-matter is less stable for some reason.  The universe exists because the creation for the universe was not perfect.  If a perfect universe existed then nothing would have formed and everything would have been a cloud soup like thing; basically evangelion tang but instead of being people being all matter and energy.\r\n\r\nDark matter is what has driven the expansion of the universe and is also what is going to eventually doom the universe.  Dark matter causes the expansion of the universe and as time goes on the universe will infinitely expand.\r\n\r\nEventually one day all the suns in the universe will run out of energy, all the energy will run out and go into the big freeze.  Eventually all forces, energy and matter will die out; all matter will eventually start dissipating into nothing.  Galaxies will lose integrity, suns will die, planets will die; it will start on the large scale.  Eventually it'll reach the point at which the universe can no longer create anything and atoms will starve dissipating as well, then quantums will die, then strings will die.  After a googol amount of years all of existence will have scratched the barrel dry and nothing will exist anymore.  All that will exist is a matter-less and energy-less universe in which nothing exists and then it will destabilize allowing for the creation of a new universe.\r\n\r\nSo in other words theoretically this isn't the first universe nor will this be the last universe, because the universe to use a analogy is like a phoenix.  It dies and then bursts forth in a ball of fire then lives then dies then is reborn then lives then dies then is reborn.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"536c097d636872035a0c0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Speaking of touhou, did you guys hear that Zun is gonna be a dad?\r\nI hope he has a daughter so he can make her wear silly hats and post it on the internet.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"536c0a046368720451850100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"We don't know why mass-less and energy-less space is unstable though; theoretically you could possibly create energy and mass with the use of non-real particles.  Non-real particles are particles that do not exist, but exist anyhow.  Basically a non-real particle is a particle-antiparticle pair that exists for brief amounts of time.  They pop into existence then immediately pop out of existence as they annihilate each other.  Granted this is still theoretical it would explain a lot about our universe, because if non-real particles are \"real\" then that would explain the creation of the universe. . Although this is primarily theory at the moment.\r\n\r\n*edit\r\nCorrection: The technical name for non-real particles is actually virtual particles.  I stand corrected.\r\n\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/536c097d636872035a0c0200#post_536c097d636872035a0c0200\r\n[bq=\"SquiggyBomb\"]Speaking of touhou, did you guys hear that Zun is gonna be a dad?\r\nI hope he has a daughter so he can make her wear silly hats and post it on the internet.[/bq]\r\nAnd my reaction will be:\r\n\"That's so adorable I'm going to-\"\r\n*HRRNNK\r\n*thud","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"536c0e9b6368724725120000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"What is the longest time someone has spent without sleeping?
