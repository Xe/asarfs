What I mean by this is that you rarely ever see stuff on par as funny as the mountain dew \"hitler did nothing wrong\" mass trolling, pranks like calling people named Patrick and asking for the Krusty Crab, David Thorne, Team Roomba or such anymore and even when trolling is done it's never as large scale or as funny as the classics.

One of my dogs, a son of her, finally found a way to get out of the house: by making a hole in the fence. Well, the hole was very tiny, and the dogs where so big to get out (one got stuck on day) but the female, and I mean the mom, could fit in the hole. She was the only one that could escape, but she returns in some hours. One day, she escaped and never come back... Oh, and one of the sons could manage to escape too, but he retuned like four days ago.
