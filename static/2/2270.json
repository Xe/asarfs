I've read about something similar on a webpage, I can't remember the article, but it said a 13 year old got shot for carrying a airsoft toy which he painted up like an actual gun. Can't remember if he was black or not, but apparently some cop mistook him for some gang member or if he mistook him for a felon, I can't remember the excuse, but yeah he got shot over that little mishap. \r\n\r\nDoes this happen at times in the US?
