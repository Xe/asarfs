The overwhelming majority of people who are still following prominent sjw members are just there to watch the show.\r\n\r\nTl:dr; In three or so months you will never have to hear about Anita Sarkeesian this or Zoe Quinn that or McIntosh that because they and their movement is rapidly being forced into obscurity.\r\n\r\nBasically I know you like trolling pro-gamergate on kym, but chances are you'll never have to hear about drama about sjw again because the sjw movement isn't necessarily dying, but rather they sjw movement being forced into obscurity.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"547bfc526368723be26f0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/547bfbfb6368724db2120100#post_547bfbfb6368724db2120100\r\n\r\nwhat? we aint talking about GG i mena my avatar has to do with that but is just cause is pretty","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"}]}
