Also one battle he was the only person intact after a mortar shell killed or wounded everyone else leading a charge while he was playing the bagpipes.  When the war ended he was sad that it was over.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53632440636872638f8a0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/536321246368720f55990000#post_536321246368720f55990000\r\nThere's being absolutely batshit insane, and then there's being Jack Churchill.","author":"5007bbdf7f123b112f00023a"},{"id":"53632657636872225d340000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/536321246368720f55990000#post_536321246368720f55990000\r\nI want to buy this guy a drink.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"536326ef6368720ef2df0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/536321246368720f55990000#post_536321246368720f55990000\r\nDid you also hear about a British Soldier who had his right arm chopped off by a Japanese soldier in Malaysia during WW2?

Simo killed them ALL! The Russians carpet bombed entire forests just of snuff him out. He only had minor shrapnel wounds. He eventually got shot in the jaw, and left the battle field for the duration of the war. But he never got killed. In fact, he made a full recovery and continued his hunting hobby.
