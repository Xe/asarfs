I know why this is!  I've been in this exact situation before, but basically the problem with promiscuity is that people can't behave like god damn adults when it comes to sex and instead behave like teens who just learned how their diddly holes work.\r\n\r\nThe reason why for example polyamory is that the more people in the relationship the more people get jealous and think that you don't love them.  The reason why even though I'm pro-legalization of polygamy I'm opposed to it also is that in order for it to work you have to have everyone be actual adults who realize that don't act like children.  If it's just three people it could work out, but as more people there are the more likely someone's going to be a shit and try and do something.\r\n\r\nIf someone just can't behave like a adult then I would massively suggest they don't have a polyamorous relationship because chances are they're going to do \"something\" that'll metaphorically blow up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso the reason why open relationships tend to fail is that again people don't act like adults.  If you're in a open relationship wear a damn gondamn you gosh darn dick.  If your significant other doesn't want a open relationship don't cheat on them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe problem I have with a lot of my relationships is that I've realized that over time or shortly after that they can't behave like adults and instead act like children.  For example if I'm with someone and they want to have sex with someone else or also be in a relationship with someone else at the same time I ask they wear a condom, they both get tested, they tell the other person that they're in a relationship already and ask them if they're okay with it, make sure the other person isn't in a closed relationship and so forth. . . and you know what?  The majority of people don't do this and it's one of the reasons why I'm single right now is because even though I'm a promiscuous person what I look for in a significant other is someone that is a mature adult and the majority of people don't actually behave like adults, they just pretend to.\r\n\r\n\r\nTl:dr; think with your brain before you stick your dick in something, but most people don't do this.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"546e77f16368720a729b0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Silent_Witness\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/546e779b6368724fb1150200#post_546e779b6368724fb1150200\r\nAgreed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"@Shadow the Hedgehog\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/546e77aa6368725ec5150000#post_546e77aa6368725ec5150000\r\nThe Soul Society arc.
