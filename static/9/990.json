The problem with cybernetics right now summarized in a single sentence, \"You can have it cheap or precise or fast but you can't have all three\".  They're already working on giving people the sense of touch, artificial parts like eyes and are already testing it on people.  The problem is making it cheap.  Right now it's in the experimental prototype phase.  Any engineer will tell you a prototype is a expensive; a experimental prototype is ungodly expensive.\r\n\r\nIn ten years it will be far more realistic to have actual cybernetics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso on the \"end of viruses\" thing; there's several experiments with nanoparticle traps for viruses.  Basically you know how if you have a cup of sugar water roaches will crawl into it and drown cause they can't get back up?  Basically imagine that for viruses.  What they're currently working on is a experimental nanoparticle that destroys the HIV virus by trapping it.  This type of nanoparticle could theoretically be applied to many other viruses and end viruses infecting humans once and for all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso I have to go take care of something, but resurrecting people from the dead.  We can revive people from being dead, but because of brain damage it's unethical if they're too far gone cause they'll be a vegetable.  There's experiments to promote new brain cell growth going on and this would massively boost our ability to revive people from death.  We could theoretically revive someone that is dead for up to 24 hours, but the thing is though if this research does come to be we're talking a extremely long recovery for the people.  You can't just pop new brain cells into someone and expect them to fully function off the bat; rather if someone does die and is revived after 24 hours the person will be looking at years of recover to recover their level of functioning they had before.  Less video game respawn and more of long ass recovery time to regain motor control.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe can \"resurrect the dead\"; it's just highly unethical.  What I mean by this is look at the decapitated dog head medical experiment: \"link\":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ub7l1D7_B2I (warning not nsfw, but not for the faint of heart cause it's disturbing to a lot of people)","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53d597736368723f23cc0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@twistedmetalero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53d592316368724941d60000#post_53d592316368724941d60000\r\nmaterialistic prick","author":"4fe16df67f123b13e400003f"},{"id":"53d59b856368724c41850000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@XxMobianEquinexX\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53d5907a6368721cf9ba0000#post_53d5907a6368721cf9ba0000\r\nThis is what happens when you make a thread for shitting around.","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"53d59fb46368722dc28a0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"All mushrooms are edible, but some only once.\r\n","author":"50b70eeb7f123b1a02000097"},{"id":"53d5a426636872089f9d0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Randomosaur\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53d59fb46368722dc28a0000#post_53d59fb46368722dc28a0000\r\nI think one type of mushroom has some sort of chemical that people claim to make your _man part_ stiffen harder.\r\nWhich mushroom was that?\r\n\r\nAs if Mario _growing taller_ wasn't suggestive enough...","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"53d5a6016368725f7b610000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!https://38.media.tumblr.com/ea310a451cc509a1ea1eef40bc3f68e0/tumblr_n91abzH4cr1rq7z94o1_400.gif!\r\n!https://31.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m92em95jHn1qdctswo1_500.gif!\r\n!https://31.media.tumblr.com/8d0d7867c69969c35f4488739c515d3f/tumblr_mrdsyaH6EI1re18o8o1_r1_400.gif!\r\n!https://31.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m0kob6yC401qauhgho1_500.gif!\r\n!https://31.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lpl1td38Wj1qi75ndo1_500.gif!\r\n!https://31.media.tumblr.com/465131df453078e96a4a928e76f91cd0/tumblr_inline_n9e30u1e2k1qm86g3.gif!","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"53d5aed363687271694a0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Shaolin Soccer HO!!!!","author":"5056c9e87f123b37f6012a34"},{"id":"53d5b0156368725fe0bf0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20140220181631/kamenrider/images/b/bd/V3_Return_Kick_(Movie_War_Mega_Max).gif!\r\nV3 return kick!","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"53d5b85f6368721a15c80000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"/mu/ did it, /mu/ FUCKING did it\r\n\r\n!http://i.4cdn.org/mu/1406511590318.png!","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"53d5b8d26368721e4b1a0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@twistedmetalero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53d5b85f6368721a15c80000#post_53d5b85f6368721a15c80000\r\nYou blew it up!
