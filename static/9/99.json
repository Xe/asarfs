You want super strength? Try and ant or a Goliath beetle, who can lift dozens of times their own weight, if a human had that strength they could pick up a city bus! Super speed? Well sure there is the cheetah but there are bugs out there so fast they can run about a 2 feet per second. While that may not see like much keep in mind the bug is only a few millimeters long. That's the equivalent of a human running the 100 meter dash in about 2 seconds. Super sight? The Golden Eagle can read a newspaper from 1000 feet away. The wetta goes into cryogenic hibernation where it's entire body freezes solid and then thaws and it comes right back to life. And then there's the Water Bear. It's basically invincible.
