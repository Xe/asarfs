If you're wondering what I mean by this is that the reason why windows has so many viruses and such is that the security for it is about as waterproof as a sponge.\r\n\r\nPersonally that's what I think they should focus on with Windows 9 is solely bug fixing, working on performance and closing as many security holes as they can find.  You're obviously never going to get a operating system perfect, but working on making windows a secure operating system and work on increasing performance would definitely be a started.\r\n\r\nIf you're wondering why windows runs so slowly versus linux is that windows is a graphically based operating system and thus a heavy resource hog.  Linux on the other hand can run on as little as 70mb ram.  The current \"desktop environment\" I'm using only uses 100mb and has all the bells and whistles.  The problem Windows has is that they're all about making it look flashy than making it fast or stable.  The problem with linux is that it's not user friendly.  The problem with mac is overpriced.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53d03a566368726a875c0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Hey guys, I need your opinion on something.\r\nIn the event that humans ever go to Equestria, if there's international issues with Equestria and surrounding nation, should humanity get involved and decide to give Equestrians a certain level of technology/weaponry to defend themselves? \r\nOr would something like this seem extraordinarily bad?

But back to the point, the world in which magic exists can be relative, there's no set law to how much a unicorn can lift with magic and also the amount of power required to lift things can be limited. We have no idea, I'm running this on a guess that there's a set limit for all unicorns.\r\n\r\nSo yeah, giving ponies WWII level of weaponry and technology is probably a very bad idea right? \r\nBecause I wanted to make Shining Armor into a marine and send him off to fight in Germaney, or send him off to battle some Griffons, or Lions.

Also in all probability magic would be a massive boost to our how advanced we are in much the same way that technology would be a massive boost to them.  \"Magic\" is just a terminology used for things we don't understand.  Things like Tigers and Pandas were once thought to be mythical creatures and that forces like the electromagnetic force was once thought to be a miracle and so forth.\r\n\r\nThe most likely long term change would be technological esoterism in that machines that mimic the way this \"magic\" would be created in much the same way that the once mystical force of electricity is now utilized by machines in ways that no one could possibly think was possible.\r\n\r\nIf \"magic\" and such was real it would just be another force in the universe that we didn't know about before in much the same way gravity was once considered magic.\r\n\r\nIf \"magic\" was real I would be the person running \"spells\" on my phone instead of a magic wand.
