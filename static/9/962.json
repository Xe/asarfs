The areas they control they can control and rather than charging into Baghdad going \"LEEROOYYYY JEEENNKIIINNNSSSSS!\".

If you destroy their country economically, religiously or government wise that will increase the chances of people rebelling.

Basically for a car start with a box then add in vertexes, edges and such and keep extracting and so forth until you have a more car like shape.  At first it'll look junky, but 99% of the work is doing the itty bitty fine detal until it looks like a car.  Cars are easy to do; they just require a lot of patience to get the fine detail.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"}]}
