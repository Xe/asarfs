If a law doesn't actually have any legal basis or such they run the risk of their legality being questioned and considering that a lot of morality laws never thought of making any justification other than \" 'Murrica!\" we're talking about a lot of laws.\r\n\r\nI guess the moral lesson of this is that the answer to everything isn't \" 'Murrica!\"; 2+2 does not equal \" 'Murrica!\", nor does the answer to a lot of questions about the legality of laws.\r\n\r\nSo yeah the anti-glbt movement is filled with dumbasses.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53d2df8d6368725b072c0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I salute you mortals","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"53d2e0966368725b5e710000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@QuasarNova\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53d2df8d6368725b072c0000#post_53d2df8d6368725b072c0000\r\n\r\ni didint notice until now the amount of shitpost quasar has done.","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"53d2e1386368723d6b230200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@twistedmetalero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53d2e0966368725b5e710000#post_53d2e0966368725b5e710000\r\n\r\n!http://www.abload.de/img/0150_54utk.gif!","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"53d2e2e2636872153c7f0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@QuasarNova\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53d2e1386368723d6b230200#post_53d2e1386368723d6b230200\r\n\r\n!http://31.media.tumblr.com/d69447fff3f3fbce821813e5551b612e/tumblr_n9828n1wbD1qdie0jo1_500.gif!","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"53d2e3e563687214a38e0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@twistedmetalero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53d2e2e2636872153c7f0100#post_53d2e2e2636872153c7f0100\r\n\r\n!http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lxngt7TaQl1qfe7jao1_400.gif!","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"53d2e47e6368726aa4440200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://31.media.tumblr.com/8a07e1a02fe596a10bddcda5932ae28e/tumblr_mh3bl72ENd1s49aaeo1_1280.png!","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"53d2e5de6368727a08440000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I am back.","author":"50b70eeb7f123b1a02000097"},{"id":"53d2e67063687218b1570200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Randomosaur\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53d2e5de6368727a08440000#post_53d2e5de6368727a08440000\r\n!https://derpicdn.net/avatars/W1siZiIsIjIwMTRcLzA3XC8xNlwvMDBfMzZfMjZfMjc3X1cxc2laaUlzSWpJd01UUmNMekEzWEM4eE5Wd3ZNak5mTWpaZk1qUmZOamcxWDNSM2FXWmhZMlV1Y0c1bklsMHNXeUp3SWl3aWRHaDFiV0lpTENJeE1qVjRNVEkxSXlKZFhRIl0sWyJwIiwidGh1bWIiLCIxMjV4MTI1IyJdXQ!","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"53d2e7596368725ac3f10100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"This is the _Ceratosaurus_ tooth I am saving up for.\r\n!http://www.indiana9fossils.com/Dinosaurs/Dinosaur-Teeth/Ceratosaurus/1-10/lg2.JPG!\r\n!http://www.indiana9fossils.com/Dinosaurs/Dinosaur-Teeth/Ceratosaurus/1-10/lg2b.JPG!\r\nAnd here is what _Ceratosaurus_ looked like:\r\n!http://csotonyi.com/Ceratosaurus_nasicornis01.jpg!","author":"50b70eeb7f123b1a02000097"},{"id":"53d2e7646368726b26c70000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SeraphimDawn\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53d2e67063687218b1570200#post_53d2e67063687218b1570200\r\n\r\nmore like\r\n\r\n\r\n\"@Randomosaur\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53d2e5de6368727a08440000#post_53d2e5de6368727a08440000\r\n\r\n!https://derpicdn.net/media/W1siZiIsIjIwMTRcLzA3XC8xNFwvMTVfMjRfMzVfODk2X2R1Y2tfYmFkZ2UucG5nIl0sWyJwIiwidGh1bWIiLCIxNngxNiMiXV0!","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"53d2e8a26368724dba990100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"Something for Squiggy.\":https://www.boneroom.com/welcome.aspx?c=719&i=3564&n=AztecBar ","author":"50b70eeb7f123b1a02000097"},{"id":"53d2ea6c63687265b9d70100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@twistedmetalero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53d2e47e6368726aa4440200#post_53d2e47e6368726aa4440200\r\nPenn and teller did a great piece on Peta.
