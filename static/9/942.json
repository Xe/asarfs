Depends really on how society reacts.  On the one hand you have massive amounts of people losing jobs, but on the other hand you have ever increasing drops in prices for good and services so while a lot of people are going to lose their jobs on the same turn it's going to promote buying goods and services due to ever increasing price slashes.  Personally I think what will probably happen is ever increasingly less hours worked on average, more part time workers and those jobs lost being offset; so while yes it's a bad thing chances are the lower prices for goods and services will offset it.  To put it simply more part time workers, but on the same token far cheaper products.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53d132f66368724f71fe0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@twistedmetalero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53d10237636872027e860200#post_53d10237636872027e860200\r\n[bq=\"twistedmetalero\"]BATMAN\r\n\r\n!https://31.media.tumblr.com/9ff2259477e75f3a1dbfac60d0f9a33e/tumblr_n97412GXkU1qa1vnto2_1280.jpg!\r\n!https://31.media.tumblr.com/1e6b785449f0eecf73cdcc7f46c6f414/tumblr_n97412GXkU1qa1vnto1_1280.jpg![/bq]\r\nI FUCKING NEED IT!\r\n\r\n\r\n\"@igotnopicks\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53d0ff9e636872022fa60000#post_53d0ff9e636872022fa60000\r\nYup, I'm not giving Nickelodeon my money ever again. :/ Fuck that.","author":"50c204917f123b31440000a5"},{"id":"53d1365c6368727937470000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Oh fuck I just thought about something, this better not mean they might Cancel the Legend of Korra Platinum game!\r\n\r\nCuz if they do that I will flip the fuck out.
