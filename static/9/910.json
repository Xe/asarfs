What I mean by this is that 99% of science fiction depicts AI as stereotypical evil, hivemind or stereotypically good or something as behaving \"logically\" while carrying out illogical behavior.\r\n\r\nIn reality the most probable outcome is that the first few AI will be based solely off people to which they will bud into other personality constructs.\r\n\r\nWhat I mean by this is most likely when we eventually do get human level intelligence AI they're going to probably be like Alpha Church(aka the original Church) and split off into other constructs such as beta, delta or epsilon based on the original personality.\r\n\r\nIf you do get a robot girlfriend she's going to be based off the original in all probability and have developed into a separate entity.\r\n\r\nIn all probability when we do get AI they're not going to be some evil overlord, but rather synthetic people in a nutshell whose personality are partially based off their \"parent\" in the same way that a lot of people share personality traits similar to their parents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you're wondering what I mean by this watch the latest episode of Red Vs Blue and you'll get the analogy.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe biggest problem of this though is mental stability of the personality constructs.  I don't mean that as a \"ermagod computers r t3h evil\" sort but rather Halo Rampancy in which AI think themselves to death.  Contrary to popular belief there isn't actually all that much information in the world; in 2011 the total amount of information in the world equaled to the total storage of a human brain.  The question is what would happen if a AI has nothing to occupy themselves; to use a analogy imagine being stuck in a room with literally nothing how long could you handle that before you got bored and how long could you handle that before you went insane?  If anything disallowing AI from accessing the net would be a far more dangerous prospect because at least they would then have sensory input to prevent boredom and/or serious psychological problems.  If anything promoting them access to the net would be a boost because such a system they would go, \"Wow; that's a lot of crap I had to go through.  So anyways I developed a home operating system complete with all software needed that is stable and secure along with a collection of a hundred games, wrote a algorithm to use telescopes to search for alien life 100k times more efficiently, a crime prevention software that can predict all violent crime with a accuracy of 99% as well as figured out a perfect economic system that can prevent any predictable bust cycle all in the time frame of 5 minutes.
