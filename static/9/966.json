Basically what I mean by this is you know how people constantly edit wikipedia or how governments try to \"creatively tell the truth\" by editing information about them?  In the future all information will be done by data scrapping bots so fast that trolling will be impossible.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I mean by this is that imagine someone on the internet trying to edit information to \"creatively tell the truth\":\r\n\"I'll edit wikipedia; that'll show those <insert whatever group of people here>!\"\r\n*put in bullshit information\r\n*bots automatically delete the false information\r\n\"Hey!

The reason why a bot like this to censor information would be much harder to do is that the Lsjbot is not a intelligent program; in order to make a censorship bot it would require a high level Ai.  Theoretically 90% of mass information will be written by bots by 2030.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53d3d36e636872228f0b0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@ParagonCommander\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53d3bb6b6368722131550100#post_53d3bb6b6368722131550100\r\nFucking wow!
