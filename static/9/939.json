I thought of a interesting question:\r\nHypothetically let's say biomechatronics reaches fruition, basically cybernetics, and while it helps amputees they offer limited aesthetic augmentations that can not be major.  Basically let's say cybernetics does become a thing, but due to limitations of it being new you couldn't replace your entire body, nor your organs, nor major parts.  What would you get?  Like you could get minor implants so long as they don't interfere with your internal organs, but not to the extent that it poses a risk.  So basically you could get something like if you do a lot of walking replace the knee down or aesthetic changes but not to the extent it's all over.  So if say you want to be a furry or such you couldn't due to limitations of your body no longer being able to properly cool down because the \"skin\" wouldn't be able to sweat.\r\n\r\nWhat would you get and why?","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53d08e256368726030920100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I cannot allow Squiggy to escape to write Shipfics!\r\n\r\n\"Henshin!\":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3i4Q-R8dJY\r\n\r\n*Transforms into Kamen rider Kuuga Mighty Form*","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"53d08e7563687261b1310100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53d08dff636872615f1a0100#post_53d08dff636872615f1a0100\r\n\r\nA retractable nail, or a sleep inhibator that corrects the \"Sleep but no rest\" problem I'll most likely develop in the future","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"53d08e7663687260a5870100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"im obssesed with death grips\r\n\r\n!http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view7/3381101/death-grips-guillotine-o.gif!\r\n\r\nand with good reason, this guys got a 10/10 album","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"53d08ebe636872604b5b0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Did Randomsaur get banned again?
