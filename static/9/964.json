The best system is a hybrid of different beliefs that complement each other's weaknesses.  Often times the countries that fall apart are the ones that zealot believe in only one system of doing things.  That's why a pure 100% capitalist/communist/socialist nation is impossible because the nations that try to do this have to either change how they do things and stop being a pure economic theory nation or fall apart after a couple months.\r\n\r\nIntroducing Confucianism to western countries would be good in much the same way introducing Socrates to eastern countries would be good as well.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53d34a886368720cd7e20000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://x2.fjcdn.com/comments/It+was+fucking+gigantic.+Kind+of+surprised+me+_702cdf5f0c3aa075d555d42cdf60b3c9.jpg!","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"53d34ac763687229ff900100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53d346ee63687218383c0000#post_53d346ee63687218383c0000\r\n\r\nSocrates held that all the cardinal virtues (wisdom, moderation, justice, courage, and piety) are on the deepest level one. Each of these is understood in terms of a psychic condition participating in the Good: the soul’s participation in the Good with respect to knowledge, wisdom; with respect to the gods, piety; with respect to what is to be dared and dreaded, courage; and with respect both to oneself and one’s position in relation to others. \r\n\r\nConfucius’ ethical system, by comparison, was more concrete in providing a multitude of detailed guidelines for behavior and speech, namely, to love people.\r\n\r\nOr the TL;DR Version and EVERYONE has repeated until they drop: DON'T BE A JERKASS!","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"53d34bd6636872485fe80000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"And for your weekly post of traps:\r\n[spoiler]\r\n!http://livedoor.blogimg.jp/nonomy/imgs/a/7/a7e030c4.jpg![/spoiler]\r\n!http://livedoor.blogimg.jp/nonomy/imgs/6/2/62250052.jpg!","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53d34c3e63687226f92f0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53d34bd6636872485fe80000#post_53d34bd6636872485fe80000\r\n\r\nOne of them has boo-Surgery, Du'h...
