If I even use concealer, it's just on certain spots. I spend a lot of time on skincare, so it's quite fair. I use a thin line of eyeliner for my eyes and some eyeshadow if I feel like it. Most days I leave my lips either bare or put on a little gloss. I always put on some eyebrow gel.\r\nFor special occasions I go all out, mostly because these occasions usually take place in the evening, when makeup is harder to see in the first place.\r\n\r\nEdit: and mascara, of course. When I put on mascara, I curl my lashes too, but that effect never lasts very long. I have used false lashes here and there, mostly for weddings and whatnot.","author":"4fe256037f123b3f940028cf"},{"id":"53ceda2963687203dd320000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"i still dont understand.\r\n\r\nR.KELLY IS UGLY AS FUCK, PEED ON AN UNDERAGE GIRL AND AHD LOTS OF CHILD PORN YET HE STILL HAS A CARRER?","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"53ceda2d63687269d6410100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@twistedmetalero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53ced8e86368725ec3010200#post_53ced8e86368725ec3010200\r\nI completely understand.
