A second ago he was in Cairo staring into the eyes of his enemy, Jotaro Kujo. Descendant of Jonathan Joestar. But now he was in a room. A white sterile room. How had he been transported here? Was it an effect of Jotaro’s stand? Before he could ponder anymore he found himself surrounded by men in strange white armor holding even stranger looking guns.. The one directly in front of him spoke\r\n\t“Identify yourself immediately!”\r\n\r\n\tDio felt his anger rising but he only chuckled at the soldier. They wished to know him so he would humor them.\r\n\t“I am a being that has far exceeded the limits of humanity. I am DIO BRANDO” he yelled holding his head high. The soldiers began to slowly approach, guns aimed at the vampire. Dio began to laugh hysterically.\r\n\t“TIME FREEZES! THE WORLD!” As time froze for the soldiers it did not for Dio. He tore through their armor like paper. His hand piercing each of their chests as he savored the taste of their blood. He landed behind the armored men licking the blood off his fingers.\r\n\t“Time continues” he said with a devilish grin. At once the soldiers screamed in pain, blood erupting from their bodies like geysers of red mist.\r\n\r\n\t“Is there no one with the power to challenge I, DIO!?” At that very moment he felt the hairs on his neck stand up. He felt a power that was at once eerily similar and frighteningly different. He turned to see a tall man. He was wearing a suit of all black and a helmet of the same color. His breathing was almost mechanical.\r\n\t“I am Lord Vader and these are my men you just slaughtered” he said in a deep booming voice. Vader raised his arm and suddenly Dio felt a tight grip on his neck. The grip was getting tighter and tighter, squeezing the breath out of him. Dio’s Stand emerged from his body and landed a punch dead center into Vader’s chest. Vader flew back as the vice-like grip on Dio’s neck was released. He fell to his knees and began to cough violently. \r\n\r\nAs soon as Dio caught his breath he looked at the strange warrior before him.\r\n“Strange. I couldn’t see his Stand” he thought to himself. Vader rose to his feet and grabbed a strange metallic device from his waist. The metal tube instantly shot a red beam from it’s top. Dio curiously stared at the red beam.\r\n“That’s an interesting weapon you have there.” Vader only stared at Dio, the red glow reflecting of of his helmet. Dio smirked as he rose to his feet.\r\n“So the silent treatment eh? That’s fine. I’ll just silence you for good!” Dio instantly closed the gap between him and Vader. His Stand emerging from his body to unleash a flurry of punches onto the black-clad warrior. Vader flew backwards a smash a hole into the wall behind him. Dio gazed at the new hole..\r\n“Weakling,” It was then that Vader stood and charged Dio, his red beam arching towards Dio’s face. Dio leapt backwards barely avoiding the blisteringly hot blade. Vader swung, slashed, and stabbed at Dio with an almost calculated aggression. Not giving the golden haired vampire a moment to rest Vader extended his hand and a mysterious force launched Dio into the wall behind.\r\n“You have no right in calling me weak.”\r\n\r\nDio rose, his eyes filled with murderous intent. He wanted this warrior’s blood. He charged Vader, his finger pressed tightly together. He attempted to pierce Vader’s arm but was stop by an odd resistance. Vader quickly swiped with his blade and Dio dodged backwards,\r\n“Your arm isn’t flesh and bone, is it” Dio asked. “I’m willing to bet most of your body isn’t.” Dio smiled at his foe. Oh well. THE WORLD!“ Time froze and Dio quickly leapt for Vader’s blade. He retreated to a safe distance and threw the red beam directly at Vader’s chest. The blade stopped a mere foot away, the frozen time affecting it.\r\n“And that takes care of that.” Time resumed and even Dio couldn’t believe what happened next. With inhuman reflexes Vaders avoided the red blade and snatched the handle out of the air. It was then that the black-clad warrior spoke.\r\n“It appears you managed to temporarily stop time. But you will never slay me with my own lightsaber.” Dio’s eyes widened. Had he been conscious in the frozen time? Was this the power of a Stand?","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"53d08a666368725fb5450000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53d0899e6368726021170000#post_53d0899e6368726021170000\r\n\r\nOk, you officially got me by the balls.
