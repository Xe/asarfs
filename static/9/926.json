Well another appeals court made a ruling. . . blah blah blah short version is the appeals court ruled that essentially if a CEO is religious that they they can file for a exemption.\r\n\r\nThis is quickly turning into a constitutional crisis because if/when this part reaches the supreme court it'll essentially be a battle between religious and personal freedoms.  What I mean by this is that if the ruling stands then well your personal and religious freedoms are getting striped away.  The reason why is that the implication of such a ruling would be essentially that the wealthy religious beliefs supersede your religious freedoms.\r\n\r\nThe reason why this is quickly becoming such a shit storm is that there's two ways this could go down in the long run; a constitutional amendment cause of how bad this is going to get to prevent such shitstorms from happening again or well say bye bye to religious freedom in the workplace folks.\r\n\r\nTl:dr; there's a constitutional crisis in the court system right now of who has religious freedom in the workplace.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53cf53cf6368725ffd6d0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53cf53076368725ffd270000#post_53cf53076368725ffd270000\r\nBoycott Hobby Lobby.","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"53cf540b6368725d233a0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SeraphimDawn\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53cf53cf6368725ffd6d0000#post_53cf53cf6368725ffd6d0000\r\n\r\nkill hobby lobby\r\n\r\n!http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/797/625/e5f.jpg!","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"53cf54876368725ffdac0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SeraphimDawn\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53cf53cf6368725ffd6d0000#post_53cf53cf6368725ffd6d0000\r\n[bq=\"SeraphimDawn\"]\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53cf53076368725ffd270000#post_53cf53076368725ffd270000\r\nBoycott Hobby Lobby.[/bq]\r\nI know most people here are probably christians and I don't mean any disrespect, but shit like this is why christianity gets so much shit from people.

You don't even need to be a \"religious\" company like Hobby Lobby to apply for the exemption.  Hence why this shit's bad.\r\n\r\nI really hope that this either doesn't go to the supreme court or is shot down cause if it does go to the supreme court and is ruled that a company can apply for religious exemption based on the owners being religious that's going to be very very very bad for religious freedom in the workplace to the point we're going to need a emergency amendment to the constitution and will be bad for every religion.  Right now a emergency bill is being worked on to limit the scope of the appeal and hopefully it'll go through cause if the bill isn't passed it's gg religious freedom g fucking g.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53cf6fbe6368725d53740200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53cf48cf63687206df4c0100#post_53cf48cf63687206df4c0100\r\nThat's a weirdly practical looking costume for a KR character","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"53cf742c63687279b7bb0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"So season 2 of RWBY premieres this Thursday.
