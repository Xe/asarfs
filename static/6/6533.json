They were like the most popular thing on the internet from 1999 to 2003. Neopets looked promising to be a primary competition to the Pokemon franchise.

Not even Furries.","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"556a9e5e6368720b233e1600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SeraphimDawn\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/556a9e496368722bb2e60200#post_556a9e496368722bb2e60200\r\n\r\nViacom happened.","author":"5041b54f7f123b77af00a442"},{"id":"556a9e8d6368726d73dc1a00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@EHAN\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/556a9e1563687224069c1200#post_556a9e1563687224069c1200\r\nIs Splatoon a short hand for Squid Platoon?","author":"52f0834d63687261cba90300"},{"id":"556a9ee163687204e9aa1800","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@And Brother I Hurt People\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/556a9e5e6368720b233e1600#post_556a9e5e6368720b233e1600\r\nShame...

Problem is, Viacom neutered it down to a criminal level. Every inch of the site became heavily policed (it was impossible to talk on the forums without having your account frozen by the computer automated modding system every once in a while), older sections of the world were shut down despite complaints, and the site eventually became a dumping ground for Nick ads. What Viacom had failed to realize is that Neopets was popular with older students and college kids; they tried advertising to a completely new crowd, which drove many of its original fans away.","author":"5041b54f7f123b77af00a442"}]}
