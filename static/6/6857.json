The reason why far less people fall for this shit nowadays is that obviously you can find people's facebooks or such and as a result if you have a picture of them walking one day ago you can debunk it.\r\n\r\nThe \"charlie charlie\" thing is the modern day equivalent of it because unlike paralysis there's no medical evidence of demon possession so whenever people discredit it the people who believe in it pull the \"you can't prove it's not true!\" card.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is going to be incredibly dickish of me, but this is more desperate than a NEET is to have sex in that it's incredibly desperate of christians to try to gain followers.  If you want to believe demon possession or whatever is real whatever, but the way you guys look like to non-christians and the overwhelming majority of people is that you look like you're practically begging people to join christianity.\r\n\r\nHow people that actually believe in charlie charlie think they look, \"See!  Demon possession is 100% scientifically proven true!\"\r\nHow they actually look to everyone else, \"Please! I beg of you!  I don't want christianity to lose anymore followers!  I beg of you to join!  Please!  *starts groveling at people's feet*\"\r\n\r\nIf to you it's just a joke then whatever, but if you actually believe it I know some people are upset that the religion is losing followers, but come on dude, this move is fucking pathetic and makes you look more desperate than a $2 hooker trying to fill their crack addiction.\r\n\r\nTl:dr; the people that are trying to use internet memes to attract followers for christianity are pathetic.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"557d175f6368726496000850","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/557d16a56368721a39000aa8#post_557d16a56368721a39000aa8\r\n\r\nOr it's just a prank some guy thought and everyone kept the ball running and see how they can run with it which is how we got today.

It happened to the protestants, it happen with the roman catholics.\r\n\r\nThree guesses as to which side of those groups are the ones that don't like that? Do I hear \"money grabbers\"? If so, then Bingo, the main core that draws money from those people are the ones that decry the end is nigh and will do what they can to bring people to them, much like they invented Hell to bring people back in the merry ol' days.\r\n\r\nAnd there's always going to be people like that, for different reasons, anywhere from desperation to honest faith that this will change their lives. So in any case, it's not something that really is worth getting angered by because A) This has always been and always will be a constant and B) Even if a religious group does lose followers, it's not going to be the end of the religion because it's a constant traffic with new people willing to take those empty seats and the ones that actually know their stuff do respect the \"Believe whatever rocks your boat as long as you don't hurt your fellow men.\" and don't give a crap.\r\n\r\nSo in short, if they are losing followers and people are desperate to get others, then just let it happen. There's a reason those people leave and new ones come, and it's gonna keep happening over and over as long as mankind has the need to believe in a higher order to carry on with their lives. So chill out negro, no need to get fuzzed over this.","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"557d1c046368724b19000641","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"And I'm just sitting here listening to rap music...","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"557d1c0b636872649600112b","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Shadow the Hedgehog\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/557d1ac563687269270029a7#post_557d1ac563687269270029a7\r\n[bq=\"Shadow the Hedgehog\"]\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/557d18d86368721a39000e13#post_557d18d86368721a39000e13\r\nDude, you are overthinking it.
