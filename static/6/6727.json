Communism is the general idea of pure equality which carries heavy disadvantages in the growing community due to the extinction of individualism. At least, that's how I see it.\r\n\r\nThe death of millions of people is indeed bad but it is not the main point on communism itself. Teens calling themselves such is probably to justify themselves in an equal circle or to gain attention. The death by communists have little to do with the teens' voluntary speech unless they have reasons in supporting that.","author":"4fe1b9f47f123b13df002976"},{"id":"5574f60763687208970003c4","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Those northern Finns are tricky\r\n!http://www.stat.fi/til/synt/2014/synt_2014_2015-04-14_kuv_003_en_001.png!","author":"4fe16df67f123b13e400003f"},{"id":"5574f6a3636872119a000b99","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"there was a screencap i saw of some russian talking about how communism didnt work because the system was abused to where the people in power stayed in power and kept the people in a stranglehold because they could\r\n\r\nid put good money on the fact that anyone who calls themselves communist nowadays is either in high school or a neet","author":"50a843d47f123b2e7c001359"},{"id":"5574f6c063687244a000022b","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@HJSDGCE\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5574f5af63687208a700031b#post_5574f5af63687208a700031b\r\nThe thing is though that communism has shown itself to be a failure of a idea that the only thing it has achieved is countless deaths whenever implemented.
