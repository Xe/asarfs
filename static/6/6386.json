Well they're already working on neural enhancement prototypes with memristors.  Basically in say idunno 40-50 years you'll be able to replace your entire brain with a computer.  When the technology eventually reaches market it will probably at first start out as augmentations, like intelligence boosters or such though and slowly move towards replacements.  Essentially if you replace parts of your brain with a computer are you still \"you\"?\r\n\r\nActually that was the story of ghost in the shell movie 1 and it's actually expanded further and further in the series as time has gone on.

The reason why memristors and that are relevant to cyborgs is that I read a article by IEET (a neuroscience organization).  Essentially if we do develop the technology to replace the human brain it won't be copying a person's mind, rather it would be a rapid streaming into the new body.\r\n\r\nEssentially less of a Glados thing where they copy the person's mind and more of a: doctor, \"are you ready for the transfer?\" patient, \"yes\" *click* *originally body thudding on the ground cause it no longer has a mind* patient, \"when are you going to start\" doctor, \"we've already finished; look at your body\" patient, \"Damn!  That was fast!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reason why we can't do it currently is because we don't have the technology to house a entire conscious and that the human brain doesn't have a peripheral port to transfer information so we have to invent one.\r\n\r\nWhat they're working on isn't the scan and copy type where the original is destroyed, but rather streaming the information.  When the technology is eventually developed in say 40 years it will still be a ultra complicated procedure with like millions of small wires coming out of the person's skull and that for rapid streaming.\r\n\r\nTl:dr; if in 40 years we have the technology to replace the human brain it probably is going to rapidly stream a conscious from the human brain to a machine brain and won't be destructive scan and copy, but rather like sucking the mind out of the brain like with a tube and putting it in the new machine brain.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"}]}
