And even though I could bare through it I found the first sets of episodes were cool and than it just kind of flopped the rest of the way through.\r\n\r\nAnd than SAO 2 came out and it did the same thing. the first parts of it all where he's trying to fined and fight Metal Face (Or whatever his name was) is awesome.\r\n\r\nBut than the rest of it after he fought Metal Face turned into a Giant filler that I was just not interested in or invested to watch. \r\n\r\nLike Pat and Liam said the show has a fucking awesome Premise but it just cant seem to hold it well like it should.
