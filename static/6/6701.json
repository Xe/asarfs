When I was a bit younger, I was, _believe me or not_, gay. That's right, people! I was gay! Of course, I didn't tell anyone about this. As I grew older, I started to mature and understand the world better and then I noticed the things people do to break any transgendered ideals and one-way marriages. Of course, I stopped being gay and instead became bisexual because it was easier to me.\r\n\r\nWhy I was gay, some might ask? I was a feminine lad and I hang out with female lads. I didn't like how boys acted when I was young and I liked how girls were actually caring instead of idiotic. Sure, I have males as friends but I wasn't that close to them. Hanging out with girls only shaped a bit of myself.\r\n\r\nToo bad nothing goes the way you wanted it to go. Boys or girls, people aren't always that accepting.","author":"4fe1b9f47f123b13df002976"},{"id":"5573a3f4636872750c00062f","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Shadow the Hedgehog\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5573a3a66368724e9a0025b8#post_5573a3a66368724e9a0025b8\r\nShe does.\r\n\r\n\"@Number1pegasus\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5573a3906368724e9a00258f#post_5573a3906368724e9a00258f\r\nPlz no.\r\n\r\n\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5573a3906368724e9a002590#post_5573a3906368724e9a002590\r\n~^Dad, no^~","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"5573a41163687235e7001265","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5573a3906368724e9a002590#post_5573a3906368724e9a002590\r\nWe need to push these terms!
