What I mean by this is that if you watch My Little Pony online or Doctor Who online cause of the current high cost for streaming video they can't afford to keep all of their show online which is why you can only watch a couple episodes out of the total.\r\n\r\nEssentially: cable companies are dicks because they know currently most show providers can't afford to put their entire show online cause of the low profit margin vs cost.\r\nGoogle is a dick because they don't want competition.  That's why you see so many shows have a price tag on youtube cause youtube is fucking them over.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy are they such dicks to companies that cut the cord entirely or don't want to use youtube cause youtube is fucking with them?  I know it's not a actual tv show, but look at red vs blue: they have their entire series on their website and they're still successful cause their success is driven by dvd sales and sales in general.\r\n\r\nAs time goes on the cost of streaming videos is going to continue to go down until individual companies can afford to startup their own internet tv sites cause cable companies fuck them over financially and youtube fucks them over financially so chances are in the long run when running your own independent site becomes more profitable than cable television they'll go \"fuck you\" and create their own sites.\r\n\r\n\r\nTl:dr; Basically say in ten years or so when the cost of streaming videos is significantly lower than it is currently due to higher internet speeds, lower internet costs and considerably better computers more and more tv companies will have their own internet tv sites.\r\n\r\nIn say ten or so years Hasbro will probably have all their shows online and all the episodes online cause the cost will be low enough to make a greater profit than if they continue to have their shows on cable.\r\n\r\n*Tl:dr of Tl:dr; Cable companies and google are dicks cause they don't want competition*","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"555b73856368721e0b380400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Thanotos Omega\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/555b722d6368721e0bbf0000#post_555b722d6368721e0bbf0000\r\n[bq=\"Thanotos Omega\"]!http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20091227112049/masseffect/images/1/11/Mass_Effect_Normandy_SR2.png!\r\nX\r\n!http://th05.deviantart.net/fs70/PRE/f/2013/166/a/8/a86fd95d259ad8a372cdd06c8c4d3a30-d695fdr.png! \r\n\r\nSHIPCETION![/bq]\r\n","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"555b73a46368723b2e550200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/555b71066368724eb0360c00#post_555b71066368724eb0360c00\r\nWOO HOO!","author":"50c204917f123b31440000a5"},{"id":"555b7554636872103bfd1200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://cfs7.tistory.com/upload_control/download.blog?fhandle=YmxvZzIyMzIyNEBmczcudGlzdG9yeS5jb206L2F0dGFjaC8wLzE0MDAwMDAwMDAwMy5naWY%3D!
