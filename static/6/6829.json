I don't think it will be Cybermen or a hivemind, but rather parents forcing their children to undergo surgery to rip off their skin and their sexual organs and remove their capability to have sex or dress in ways you don't like.  After all the only way to stop your children from dating people you don't like is to physically rip out their sexual organs and rip off their skin and replace it with metal.\r\n\r\nI don't think it will be cybermen so much as extremists ripping off their children's skin and sex organs to prevent them from ever having sex or having any interest in sex or dressing in ways you deem \"wrong\".\r\n\r\nHypothetical group, \"Join Unity!
