That call was a few hours ago and I am extremely nervous.\r\n\r\nI guess they're checking those who still want the scholarship since most of the participants are already in local colleges or other scholarship programs. The scholarship I took was a bit negligent as it didn't process the candidate choices early enough so everyone (including myself) was forced to make a risky decision. \r\n\r\nI should be in a local college right now but instead, I took the risk of waiting for my scholarship. So, I really hope on getting this program.","author":"4fe1b9f47f123b13df002976"},{"id":"557d7a0563687225e4005483","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://i.imgur.com/e9NND1i.jpg!\r\n\r\nHow I imagine too_offensive.","author":"37e5b9d66361642500af5e00"},{"id":"557d8a606368727584004310","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/557d394c6368726a7a001688#post_557d394c6368726a7a001688\r\n[bq=\"SquiggyBomb\"]\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/557d38ad63687263db001869#post_557d38ad63687263db001869\r\nBasically it's a sort of tournament they're doing in Splatoon.
