We were here for a special event being hosted by both the town and the Grand Canyon Railway. It's a special train that's part of the Williams Train Days event that happens yearly over in town.\r\n\r\nIt's pretty much a summer outdoors event where people show up to have fun in the sun and get to ride on the special Cataract Creek Rambler (which the railway's only working steam engine, and the main attraction itself, was available to pull all day long back and forth across town) Lots of people were showing off their old antique vehicles, like cars and tractors. (Didn't take any pics of them, sorry.)\r\n\r\nEven a few diesel engines were parked next to the station on display for people to explore the inside of them.\r\n\r\nHere's one of them (the next pics are mine btw):\r\n!http://i.imgur.com/OzAz8AF.jpg!\r\n\r\nA cab view of inside the Grand Canyon Railway #237:\r\n!http://i.imgur.com/CXR0q3I.jpg!\r\n\r\nOh, and here's EHAN too:\r\n[spoiler]!http://i.imgur.com/7jkH3l4.jpg!\r\nHe got up a little late.
