The winner gets $100, a link on the DVD case, something for their portfolio, and that always fantastic promise of “exposure.” Yes, portfolios, meaning they’re asking professional artists to make some art for free in the vain hope of having Channel Awesome make a profit off their work on their DVD. Keep in mind, only the winner gets paid.\r\nKeep in mind, Doug mentions they’re looking for Drew Struzan style artwork, otherwise known as the painter guy who’s done all the iconic posters of your childhood (Star Wars, Harry Potter, Indiana Jones, etc). For the chance at $100 and exposure. Because lord knows if you’ve got that kind of talent you need Channel Awesome for exposure. \r\nAlso they offer no reference photos, Doug just said “there’s pics of us on the internet, google it, lol”\"","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"555005636368725d6fd60200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F0VrfhJpP8 tornado might drop, here watch, naow","author":"37e5b9d66361642500af5e00"},{"id":"555005646368724690570700","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5550052d6368725b25150300#post_5550052d6368725b25150300\r\nI only have the PC version sadly.","author":"5012e49c7f123b4012000341"},{"id":"555005646368722ad1010900","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5550052d6368725b25150300#post_5550052d6368725b25150300\r\n\r\nHere","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"5550058763687256b29f0300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/555004e863687219ba490000#post_555004e863687219ba490000\r\nI wanna see a movie where mark goes back in time and does some army of darkness shit \r\n\r\n\r\n\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5550052d6368725b25150300#post_5550052d6368725b25150300\r\nmoi ","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"555005b76368726d87ef0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/555005436368726d87610200#post_555005436368726d87610200\r\nThat wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be.","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"555005b763687219ba460100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"That's three so far including me.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"555005b86368724690dd0700","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I don't have any GTA games","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"555005ca63687255d1170d00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Kaz\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/555005636368725d6fd60200#post_555005636368725d6fd60200\r\n[bq=\"Kaz\"]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F0VrfhJpP8 tornado might drop, here watch, naow[/bq]\r\n\r\n\r\nits a live stream storm chase","author":"37e5b9d66361642500af5e00"},{"id":"555005cf63687246900b0800","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Kaz\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/555005636368725d6fd60200#post_555005636368725d6fd60200\r\noh shat\r\ngot it in another tab nao ","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"555005e76368725d6fb60300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5550052d6368725b25150300#post_5550052d6368725b25150300\r\n[bq=\"SquiggyBomb\"]Wait okay, so let's do a quick rolecall.\r\nHow many of us have a PS3 version of GTA5?[/bq]\r\nNope me","author":"5239db6da4c72d22d9000358"},{"id":"555005f46368722ad11d0a00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/555005cf63687246900b0800#post_555005cf63687246900b0800\r\n\r\nyay, its pretty awesome amirite","author":"37e5b9d66361642500af5e00"},{"id":"555005f76368724690520800","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/555005b76368726d87ef0200#post_555005b76368726d87ef0200\r\nThat's one thing he's done\r\nHonestly just go to Obscurus Lupa's tumblr for more on why Doug and CA are awful","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"555006056368725d6fdb0300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Shadow the Hedgehog\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/555005236368725d6f810200#post_555005236368725d6f810200\r\nmy sister would smoke in front me a bunch of times and i always smelled it on her clothes whenever she walked b,  im never getting used to the scent and im glad i wont","author":"4ffbfff37f123b072a01bb5b"},{"id":"555006146368725d6fe30300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"My brother plays it more than me though.
