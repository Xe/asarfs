Yeah, yeah I know touhou, video games, broken record as fuck. . but I realized something financially; Zun(the guy who makes the games) is a god damn genius; I don't mean that about the games or anything, but the dude's figured out the perfect video game making strategy to stay in business for decades as a independent developer.\r\n\r\nVideo games are a high risk business the larger the production; if you have a AAA game there's a very high risk that you could blow it and lose hundreds of millions of dollars and tons of people lose their jobs.  Zun on the other hand makes his video games solely by himself and occasionally lets other people develop third party games.  It takes the indie business model and raises the bar financially.  What I mean by this is that AAA games are extremely high risk high reward, indie games are low risk low reward; Zun on the other hand is extremely low risk.\r\n\r\nI'm probably going to steal this sort of business model and do it myself cause even indie games still have a moderate amount of risk if your cost of development is higher than your profit.  Dude's been making video games independently for nineteen years independently and making a living off it.\r\n\r\nIf other people were to adopt this financial strategy of one person making short video games annually they would probably be in business for a long time, but the problem is though is that too many people get over excited and try to make a forty hour game in only a year; you straight up can't do that.  A more realistic estimate is make a thirty minute video game that's extremely high quality, low price and you'll be in business for decades.\r\n\r\nThe only reason why the games cost so much is cause of physical download; it's why the games are probably going to go to Steam cause that would further reduce financial risks in the games and ensure they continue for decades to come.\r\n\r\nI'm probably going to do that for my game; make a thirty minute game, sell it digitally and for only a couple dollars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTl:dr; The best long term business model is low risk investments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I was a evil cartoon villain what I'd do is buy up every low risk investment in the world and laugh my ass off when a financial bubble pops.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53aa18bd6368721d41c20100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I wonder why Kamen rider has such a hard time in the west?\r\n\r\nSaban's attempt crashed and Burned\r\n\r\nAnd That one adaptation of Ryuki, While good, Didn't do that well","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"53aa1a3a6368721b9bfc0300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53aa18bd6368721d41c20100#post_53aa18bd6368721d41c20100\r\n[bq=\"trashboat\"]I wonder why Kamen rider has such a hard time in the west?\r\n\r\nSaban's attempt crashed and Burned\r\n\r\nAnd That one adaptation of Ryuki, While good, Didn't do that well[/bq]\r\nCause of differences in culture.
