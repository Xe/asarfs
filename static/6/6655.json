Probably the reason white people usually make white characters. Which is not bad by any means if you ask me.\r\n\r\nAgain though I would argue that the creator should feel a desire to make a different race character. Otherwise it could very well be crap cause they feel forced and are unininspired.\r\n\r\nAgain. Miles Morales. Bendis wanted to make Miles (also it helps hes a good writer...ussually), he crafted a good backstory, a good cast, and potential for new stories with Miles. Not once did he point out \"Look! he's Black!\" He just let the stories about the character be told.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion that's a good way to do diversity. Just. Tell. A good.
