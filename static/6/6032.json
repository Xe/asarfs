People who genuinely believe in helping others and those that wish to be good.  Call me crazy, but the people who wish to be good are of more value because it takes a deliberate attempt for them to good rather than it coming naturally.\r\n\r\nThe way I view it is that hypothetically speaking let's say you become the world leader and there's no such thing as resistance against whatever you do: congratulations what is your point?  Everything you could possibly do will be washed away in a generation after your death and nobody will remember you in time.  You could be the world's biggest bastard and declare nuclear war and wipe out all life on earth.  Congratulations; what have you accomplished in the universe?  Why are you important to any extent?\r\n\r\nThe road to good isn't paved with trying to prove one's self good or even trying to make a difference; rather it's paved with even knowing that no matter what you do you will not be important you do it anyhow.  If you give food to the homeless your act of kindness means nothing on the macro scale, but it's still important cause you did it anyhow.\r\n\r\nEssentially: what matters isn't how much you do to help others, rather the fact that you do it in spite of knowing that your act doesn't matter and do it anyhow.\r\n\r\nTl:dr; \"good\" isn't about trying to make a difference; it's about doing it anyhow.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"554fe05e6368722549260700","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Shit now I have this idea in my head for a beast boy trailer. \r\nIt'd be cellphone video of a green wolf in a park doing backflips and stuff then holding a cap for people to put money in and then running off into some alley \r\nAnd then the person filming follows the wolf into an alley, sees the wolf turn a corner and then when they turn the corner there's a freakin green T. rex and it chases them away\r\n\r\n^too bad there's never gonna be a beast boy movie cuz he's not edgy enough 4 dc^","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"554fe09d6368722516210800","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/554fe05e6368722549260700#post_554fe05e6368722549260700\r\nI can dig it!","author":"50c204917f123b31440000a5"},{"id":"554fe14a6368721003b00a00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"I wanna go sliding\":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfmVlP0zB5A","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"}]}
