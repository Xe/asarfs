And that book has confirmed something I've always suspected about Neil Gaiman's writing style. It's very English. Like I don't want to call it \"stiff\" but the ways he writes is very \"no frills.\" He avoids flowery language and wordplay for just direct tellings of what is going on. The Graveyard Book, American Gods, Coraline and his numerous other stories have that peculiar style. And that \"no frills\" style of writing actually helps set the mood of his darker stories. It feels genuinely creepy.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"557a0da763687214d4000134","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/557a0d326368722742001227#post_557a0d326368722742001227\r\nYOOOOOOOOOO I just finished Coraline yesterday","author":"54ff97db636872754d922f00"},{"id":"557a0e0263687217d70015eb","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@masquerade\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/557a0da763687214d4000134#post_557a0da763687214d4000134\r\nI'm about halfway through.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"557a0ee363687217d70017d3","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"perhaps","author":"50a843d47f123b2e7c001359"},{"id":"557a0f5863687217d700188f","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/557a0e0263687217d70015eb#post_557a0e0263687217d70015eb\r\nIts so good\r\nSo much better than the movie","author":"54ff97db636872754d922f00"},{"id":"557a11d96368720195000296","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@masquerade\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/557a0f5863687217d700188f#post_557a0f5863687217d700188f\r\nI would actually argue that the movie was better. Because the pacing was better in the movie. Pacing has never been Gaiman's strength. Atmosphere and characterization he can do but he tends to be too brief and quick in his stories. Jumping from one scene to another without letting the audience fully immerse themselves in the story. The fil avoided that by slowing down it's pace and letting the audience breathe. And that extra bit of breathing room helps make the creepy scenes with the Other Mother that much creepier. Not to mention we got to see LAIKA doing what LAIKA does best with all of those GORGEOUS clay miniatures.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"557a126363687201780003b0","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"What is it about Man in the Iron Mask that draws me to it?","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"557a12ff6368720fc70002d4","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/557a11d96368720195000296#post_557a11d96368720195000296\r\nNah\r\nThe books creepier.
