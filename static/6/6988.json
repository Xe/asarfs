Since we had about a couple hours to kill, we decided to explore for a bit and had a quick lunch.\r\n\r\n+Getting out tickets for our train ride today:+\r\n!http://i.imgur.com/7dISnh1.jpg!\r\n\r\nSince the railway runs a train (or two) almost everyday of the year, except on Christmas Eve and Day, for the normal train trips to the Grand Canyon itself, a little Wild-West show happens nearby the station to entertain the travelers until the train pulls into the station and picks passengers up for departure.\r\n\r\nIt's no Blazing Saddles, let me tell you, but it's quirky and odd enough to be at least quite amusing.\r\n!http://i.imgur.com/nu01Hpr.jpg! \r\n!http://i.imgur.com/yXjGMQi.jpg!\r\n~heh that poor guy got shot~\r\n\r\nSo as soon as we were finishing up lunch, I started hearing noises. Naturally I assumed that I was listening to some music playing trains sounds, but then it started to get louder...\r\n\r\nSo I turn around and then I saw it coming in:\r\n!http://i.imgur.com/AcTvKdR.jpg!\r\n\r\n*Eeyup, there it was: _our ride for the day coming back in from the earlier trip we missed earlier._*\r\n\r\n!http://i.imgur.com/8vtD5nF.jpg!\r\nYou can probably guess what kind of face I was making when it finally arrived.\r\n\r\nDespite my joy and enthusiasm, I was actually pretty darn calm and reserved the whole time.\r\n\r\nGrand Canyon Railway #4960 is pretty much the 'mascot' of the railway itself. It's one of the few operation steam locomotives in North America, one of the very rare steam trains found in Arizona, and the only steam train on the railway itself that's still in use. The rest are no longer in operation and/or on indefinite static display for the foreseeable future.\r\n\r\nHere's one of them on display (the rest are stuck inside the locomotive workshops nearby):\r\n!http://i.imgur.com/KaTMdPD.jpg!\r\n\r\n#4960 pulling the special Cataract Creek Rambler arrived on-time around noon, and it needed to rest for a bit after unloading passengers from the 11 AM trip. So I took the liberty to take some picture of it and admire its beauty.\r\n\r\nAround 12:45, the call was given for passengers to start boarding the 1 PM train.\r\n!http://i.imgur.com/42P7yub.jpg!\r\n\r\nWe weren't given assigned seating, so we could sit anywhere onboard the train. We decided to sit in the first car closest to the engine.\r\n!http://i.imgur.com/WDBLcZR.jpg!\r\n\r\nAll aboard!\r\n!http://i.imgur.com/AD0SMxO.jpg!\r\n\r\nRight on time, the train was given the OK to leave the station, and we went off on our merry way out into the outskirts of town.\r\n\r\n*More to Come in Part 3!*","author":"536f7a11636872666e2d0000"},{"id":"55873c426368722b52000420","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@EHAN\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55873b736368722b520002d7#post_55873b736368722b520002d7\r\n\r\nIt's the only way for them to unlock their \"true power\":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncTSzWpcno0","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"55873c4d6368724567001749","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@hype\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55873ba26368722de80002c9#post_55873ba26368722de80002c9\r\nMost of it sounded stupid in my head.
