Large scale mecha would be too vulnerable in wars and would instantly get blown up.

That particular machine is practically impossible to tip over and even on slick surfaces it can keep traction and it can incline at a greater degree than most vehicles.\r\n\r\nThe reason why the DoD is investing in such robots is that the afghanistan war lasted so long because the taliban was in terrain that vehicles couldn't go.  They're essentially making machines that makes guerrilla warfare ineffective.\r\n\r\n\r\nEssentially:\r\nThe taliban hid in the mountains and that's why the war took so long -> the DoD is working towards vehicles that can climb cliff faces.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would kind of be hard for guerrilla fighters to hide in mountains if the military can just drive a fucking tank up the side of a cliff.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5561a49763687260d2e10200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5561a1806368721997bc6700#post_5561a1806368721997bc6700\r\nYou know, Mechs could be viable in space as sort of a dexterous short range vehicle\r\nI mean a human shape would be impractical but still. \r\n\r\nThus adding to the list of reasons why we need space colonies ","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"5561a521636872025a101100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5561a49763687260d2e10200#post_5561a49763687260d2e10200\r\n!http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/0/04/Rb-79.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120630062609!\r\nThey would probably look more like this or something.","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"5561a5fb6368726068670500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5561a49763687260d2e10200#post_5561a49763687260d2e10200\r\nThey would be ungodly difficult to maneuver unless you're talking about something like Gradius where it is a mech but you only need the mech form for very specific things.
