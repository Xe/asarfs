A game is a game regardless of it's budget.

I noticed that indie games are different due to the freedom that indie developers have. So, the quality of the games depends on the kind of game it is made. Most indie games these days are usually to express artistic value so the style and gameplay doesn't follow the usual mechanic used by various games supported by producers. Due to that, indie games shouldn't be comparable to those games since it's too different.","author":"4fe1b9f47f123b13df002976"},{"id":"5576374b6368721994001a2b","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@HJSDGCE\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/557635ed6368724752000f40#post_557635ed6368724752000f40\r\nNo. I said it earlier. A game is a game. Making exceptions to criticism based solely upon whether or not something is \"indie\" or not misses the entire point of criticism. People DON'T CARE about a game's budget. They DON'T CARE about a game's dev process. They only care if it's good. Because a critic does serve the creator. A critic serves the audience.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"557637a263687216bb000b92","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@EHAN\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/557635e46368727d6c000bc2#post_557635e46368727d6c000bc2\r\nRemember that silly little double thing where I took the octopus scene and put it to \"You Will Know Our Names\"?\r\n","author":"515ddf93a4c72d8a1f000d57"},{"id":"557638f66368724296000607","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@ParagonCommander\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/557637a263687216bb000b92#post_557637a263687216bb000b92\r\noh wait yeah XD","author":"9ba2e84e636164642cc03200"},{"id":"55763a3763687242960007c6","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"What is Fall Of Equestria?","author":"4fe1b9f47f123b13df002976"},{"id":"55763a436368723968000c7e","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@EHAN\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/557638f66368724296000607#post_557638f66368724296000607\r\nI JUST HAD ANOTHER IDEA BRB","author":"515ddf93a4c72d8a1f000d57"},{"id":"55763a776368727d6c0013c6","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@HJSDGCE\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5576342a6368727d6c000961#post_5576342a6368727d6c000961\r\nNah\r\nIndie developers can create games just as good if not better than larger companies.
