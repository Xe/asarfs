The Nephila Clovata or the Joru Gumo. A sub-species of the gold orb-weaving spider. Said to be particularly loved in Japan due to their bright coloration and shape. Gold orb-weavers are venomous but their venom is non-lethal to humans. Some numbing, redness, and blistering will occur around the bite. At worst you'll have an allergic reaction and you'll have some minor respiratory problems.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"55512e2d6368726f7af90900","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55512c046368726f7aed0700#post_55512c046368726f7aed0700\r\nNo. Spiders are the best/worst","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"55512eb3636872162f190900","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Number1pegasus\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55512da3636872162ff60700#post_55512da3636872162ff60700\r\nBelive me, you don't know how much time I took to finally go to the gym.\r\nI recently went there because my father convinced me.\r\nThere is a guy in the gym that I go, he is almost in Schwarzenegger level, and is nice with everyone.","author":"5239db6da4c72d22d9000358"},{"id":"55512f386368724f99620100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Now I'm on a spider kick.
