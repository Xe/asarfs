should try it dude i was with some friends monday and they smoked weed but i'm too american for that so w/e i pulled out some good old fashioned marlboro reds and got a buzz going on so it was cool and then we went and played frisbee but one guys knee hurt so we didnt play for long so we talked for a bit and then we went and got pizza and ate it at a park and played around on the buildings but then a mother showed up with some kids so we decided to chill at this other guys place where they had a bong and my friends smoked that but once again im american n i came to this country to be american so i didnt smoke so it kind of sucked because id only brought two cigs with me and it was like 85 out so i smoked my second one at the park  and it felt awesome but yeah we just chilled at this other guys place for a few hours and then headed home\r\n\r\nit was fun though, and i wouldnt have done it if i were so introverted. cancer sticks calm me down and help a lot with social anxiety. you should find something not as dangerous to help you be extroverted though, a lot of people aren't too accepting of them\r\n\r\n[spoiler]i'm working on my run on sentences guys, how'd i
