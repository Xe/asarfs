The most likely thing that will happen with that is birth rates will continue to drop offsetting most of this.  In some countries the birth rate per couple is nearing one; give it a couple decades and countries will have to have immigrants to offset the population decline or face economic stagnation.  What I mean by this is that more and more countries will adopt mass immigration to keep population from free falling due to low birth rates or face free falling population like how Japan has a severe problem with population growth right now and refuses immigrants due to social reasons.\r\n\r\nTo use a analogy the birth rate in the usa the last couple of years has gone from 2.1 to 1.8; what's worse is this continues to slip; eventually it's going to slip to the point where population decline becomes a severe economic problem. . . and honestly I don't care about free falling birth rates cause it's actually going to offset long term loss of jobs due to technology change so call me a prick or whatever, but the birth rate decline is actually good in that it's offsetting potential future economic decline due to changes in technologies.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53aba3f0636872126b1e0400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://politicalclimate.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/la_brea_tar_pits.jpeg!\r\nThis lake looks like a nice place to swim in.","author":"50b70eeb7f123b1a02000097"},{"id":"53aba5d163687211ef920500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"For uc9, from Russia with Love.
