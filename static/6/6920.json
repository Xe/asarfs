About a yea ago, an old lady died. Apparently this lady was a real traveler andknew a lot of people, however all her stuff was practically thrown away I dont know why. My brothers and I began to dig inthethe pile of things and took a lot of it, among these things we found a lot of old discs, the lnes that can pnly be played in those old machines, phonographs. All of them were very old and inside of one of the discs I found a very old score signed with a lot of symbols, most of them unreadable but with the notes very much in good state. I can read notes and play the piano a little but considering what I saw it requires a much more talented player. Interested? Its called the \"Tamborileo\" or drumming.","author":"520901737f123b14a50000d8"},{"id":"55823aa663687238c3000fce","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@MoogSourceVermona\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/558239fe63687266c5004e12#post_558239fe63687266c5004e12\r\nYeah. I can agree on that.\r\n\r\nMy Sister has one Dog that is pretty Dumb. (Though he is getting better now)\r\n\r\nYeah I don't know why I was being so pissy earlier. Some Dogs can be really annoying at times. Especially if you don't train them. \r\n\r\nI guess I just got Pissy because I love my Dog so much.
