Other countries have different stereotypes and they don't get our stereotypes.  It's why say Japan or such *CONSTANTLY* laughs their asses off at americans cause we have a lot of stereotypes that legitimately don't make any sense; so every time you see people in the usa get upset about something that isn't politically correct in our country everyone just laughs at us.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand you can argue that \"other countries need to mind our cultural sensitivities\" or other such beliefs, *BUT* on the other hand wouldn't the belief that other countries \"need\" to follow our cultural norms be ethnocentric?  To use an analogy let's say someone got angry at you cause you don't see what is the problem with calling someone matzoh and they got angrier and angrier at you; would you think that to be ethnocentric for a person to believe that you as a foreigner have to know their cultural rules?\r\n\r\nIt's why other countries cultures are starting to bleed into the usa while the usa's culture is seeing less and less influence.  It's why say anime, manga, japanese games have so much influence in subcultures in the usa whereas the usa has fucking no influence in japan.\r\n\r\nPersonally I think it's just outright racist whenever people think that their cultural rules have to circumvent other cultural rules in other countries and that our rules have to be everyone's rules.\r\n\r\n\r\nTl:dr; one can say that Champions dressed up as native americans is offensive, but on the other hand isn't saying that people who live outside of the usa have to follow our culture racist?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYour logical fallacy in a nutshell: usa's cultural sensitivities are offensive -> therefore other cultures have to follow our culture.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5556090963687226e1991800","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Carcass Strife\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/555607396368724dd3450a00#post_555607396368724dd3450a00\r\nPCMR pls","author":"5307a92d6368722c6c0d0100"},{"id":"555609436368724dd3e80c00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/555607c36368723327c32200#post_555607c36368723327c32200\r\nWhile i agree that it is wrong to expect everyone to adhere to our social norms, there are completely different ones that are applicable else where to compare them too, look at how sensitive europe is about about anti semitisim thanks to WW2, i feel we can all agree that we at the very least can avoid implications of bigoted or backwards views on races/cultures,","author":"509f70a87f123b77eb0004fd"},{"id":"555609bd6368723dc98f0300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I think my Greninja skills have gotten a bit rusty.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"55560a0f6368725f346a0700","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Zak_Inc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5556090963687226e1991800#post_5556090963687226e1991800\r\nThere's already mods, in case you didn't know.\r\nLike a gun that shoots cars.","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"}]}
