Presidents are most active during their first two years.  Essentially by the time democrats get enough seats in congress she'll be too long on in her presidency to try to backstab the people.\r\n\r\nThe reason why I think that is going to be good is that when you look at it tea partiers politically are dying; all we have to do now is wait long enough for authoritarian democrat niche to die.  If Hillary becomes a dead on arrival president then she can't try to backstab the people and thus can't claim she did all the good she'll take credit for.\r\n\r\nThe way I'm viewing it:\r\nTea party is dying\r\nIf Hillary is a dead on arrival president then she won't be able to pass authoritarian legislation.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"557565366368726ec5000ff1","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55755e6c63687239fb000adf#post_55755e6c63687239fb000adf\r\nTea Partiers are authoritarian?\r\nI always understood them as\r\nmore libertarian but not okay with the libertine-ism aspects of it","author":"4fe16df67f123b13e400003f"},{"id":"5575655c6368726ec500105e","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Whatevs\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/557565366368726ec5000ff1#post_557565366368726ec5000ff1\r\nDerp; it's 5am and I haven't had any sleep in two days.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"557566176368726ee7000d35","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5575655c6368726ec500105e#post_5575655c6368726ec500105e\r\nSleep!
