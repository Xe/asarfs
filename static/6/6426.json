Essentially if gay marriage is completely legalized they know that support for their cause will slowly slip away.  It's not that much of a stretch to assume that 6% that only oppose it cause they think it should be done through voting will start slipping into the \"I don't care\" crowd and that.  I would not be surprised if in say five or so years only somewhere in the ballpark of 15% to 20% of the usa is against same sex marriage cause 30%-6% = around 24% and probably opposition to same sex marriage will continue to dwindle until only the fanatics are left.\r\n\r\nEssentially: they know that they can't win, they're just trying to cling onto having their morals stay popular for as long as they possibly can.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5563cd4b6368722b88180c00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Just finished watching Generation Kill\r\n\r\n!https://data.archive.moe/board/a/image/1340/75/1340754795003.gif!","author":"5007bbdf7f123b112f00023a"},{"id":"5563cd8963687211b6320300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Shadow the Hedgehog\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5563ccff6368724086c90000#post_5563ccff6368724086c90000\r\nNo it means as long as i like something and it's sentient + female i will theoretically be sexually attracted to it,","author":"509f70a87f123b77eb0004fd"},{"id":"5563cde16368723304a90800","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Thanotos Omega\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5563cd8963687211b6320300#post_5563cd8963687211b6320300\r\nThat's sorta admirable","author":"4fdef063945b700a9d01604f"},{"id":"5563ce5f6368724441f10700","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Thanotos Omega\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5563cd8963687211b6320300#post_5563cd8963687211b6320300\r\nCome play with us Danny!
