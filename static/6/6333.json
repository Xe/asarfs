Me and my family went to Disney World one summer. It was suoer fun. And I decided to buy a souvenir. A bought the pendant from the first Pirates of the Caribbean film. O go back to school and show it off to everyone. Paul says that he's always wanted one so me being the cool guy that I am, I take it off and say \"Happy birthday!\" He immediately starts trying to give it back saying it's too much but I ain't havin' it.  So about two weeks go by and he wears the pendant everywhere. Then one day he walks straight up to me, goes into his bag, pulls out a belt buckle shaped like the Triforce and just gives it to me. And he looks at ke and goes \"Happy birthday.\"","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"55600d386368727651640200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@EHAN\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55600cfc636872346bc20600#post_55600cfc636872346bc20600\r\nIt was stimulating,","author":"509f70a87f123b77eb0004fd"},{"id":"55600d4663687276516a0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://i.imgur.com/yW5RQri.png!","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"55600d746368721c78f73300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55600c0c636872589c1f1200#post_55600c0c636872589c1f1200\r\nOh, Oh my...\r\n\r\nWell a, I can imagine what that kid is probably doing.
