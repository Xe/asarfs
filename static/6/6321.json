Before Jojo became the Internet superstar it is now it was more of a niche manga. And proper scans of the series were really hard to come by. It was so bad that the scanlators actually used the CHINESE version of the manga before they could translate it. So they took a manga that was originally in Japanese, that got translated to Chinese and then translated that into English. Needless to say the results were _HILARIOUS._","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"555f8c0f63687242836a4b00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/555f8b8c63687237aef70900#post_555f8b8c63687237aef70900\r\nResi1 levels of hilarious?","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"555f8c5363687241f7610900","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/555f8c0f63687242836a4b00#post_555f8c0f63687242836a4b00\r\nTAKE A FUCKING LOOK!\r\n!https://tsuzukusekai.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/what_a_beautiful_duwang.jpg!","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"555f8c9f63687237aed80b00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/555f8c0f63687242836a4b00#post_555f8c0f63687242836a4b00\r\n\r\n\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/555f8c5363687241f7610900#post_555f8c5363687241f7610900\r\nOh god what!
