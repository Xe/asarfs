Watch any video that has THGTHG explaining something.\r\nStep 2. Read the text below with that voice.\r\n\r\nAbout 2 years ago, similar to that of 8 pony years in Equestria at the planet Terra with the North Sector of the North Sector of the East Sector of the North Sector of the Galaxy, a young and more or less ambitious man who goes by his DJ name, cb5 decided that he wanted to express his feelings of love and philosophy and all the other things that nobody cares of to the web. So, he did just that. Except he didn't.\r\n\r\nThere was paperwork to be filled and investments to be made before the thread could even begun to exist. It didn't take long since the MODs (Machine-like Overlords of Derpibooru) didn't really care much as long as the residents and occasional slaves follow the guidelines they have placed. Guidelines that very little read. Which is why this book exists.\r\n[/bq]\r\nThen existed this thread. Of course, there was nothing here at first. It didn't even have a name. He may have left that out for quite some time, maybe named it something ridiculous like the \"Slayers of Mike\" or something. He then opened the thread to the public and it had a grand opening too, sponsored by our very own Derpibooru Inc. widely known for it's range of products such as miniature violins and fluffy balls of ponies to be used as washing cloths or tennis balls. You can even hug them too if you feel like it.\r\n\r\nIts first entry was by a man named Vlakc, an awkward man who apparently was not Russian like some people speculated. He also posted the first image, now long lost due to the ever changing codes of the Internet. At first, the thread was full of talks about their own personal lives but it was not Facebook because of two reasons. One, nobody gets paid for it and two, nobody goes around and complain about their lives and expect people to care about something so trivial. But still, it was a fun place to be and would slowly grow as the most active thread in history.\r\n\r\nOf course, that took years until it would grow to such lengths. Most people would rather shoot hobgoblins in the buttocks with slingshots and dance with a robotic Micheal Jackson. But still, it would not stop growing. It took years until people started to notice it. Some feel it as a threat of a thread and tried to destroy it with a large cannon. Thankfully, the cannon never went off because they forgot the blackpowder. And it was already noon, so it felt as a waste of time. That's how the name came to be. Also because its easily misplaced creator, cb5 thought it was funny. Well, it wasn't.","author":"4fe1b9f47f123b13df002976"},{"id":"5563e554636872576a050100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Number1pegasus\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5563e27d63687203b3340a00#post_5563e27d63687203b3340a00\r\nI'm going to go to sleep in a few minutes, cause the amount of homophobic xenophobic racist bullshit people say against japan is legitimately pissing me the fuck off.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe justifications of people trying to censor summarized:\r\n\"I support gay rights so we need to keep gays out of mass media\"\r\n\"I support multiculturalism so we need to keep japan's culture out of the usa\"\r\n\"I support different races so we need to keep japs out of the usa\"","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5563e5de6368723a72e10600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5563e554636872576a050100#post_5563e554636872576a050100\r\nInner peace.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"5563e6666368725194eb1900","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Number1pegasus\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5563e34a6368723a726f0300#post_5563e34a6368723a726f0300\r\nDone.\r\nAdded the last paragraph based on your idea.","author":"4fe1b9f47f123b13df002976"},{"id":"5563e6a863687264aa8d0600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Two mecha in the japanese avengers would probably be a bit much tho.","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"5563e6fa6368723a72a50800","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5563e6a863687264aa8d0600#post_5563e6a863687264aa8d0600\r\nNever 'nuff Mecha","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"5563e73663687264aa4d0700","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"[walks in]\r\nWell, I'm back froâ€”\r\n[sees everything]\r\n[walks out]","author":"5201b5c0a4c72d0d9b0001e4"},{"id":"5563e74d636872191c760100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5563e554636872576a050100#post_5563e554636872576a050100\r\nRest well.\r\nDon't let this shit eat the best out of you.","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"5563e7e263687257855e0400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@toxicrystal\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5563e73663687264aa4d0700#post_5563e73663687264aa4d0700\r\nWimp.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"5563e80c6368725194cd1c00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5563e7e263687257855e0400#post_5563e7e263687257855e0400\r\nI guess you're right.
