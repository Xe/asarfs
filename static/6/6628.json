Right now you have to worry about cost of physical distribution, the cost of publishing, the cost of advertisement; a million different costs before they can even make the game and unrelated to actually making a game.  If companies can just sell their games directly then they can just make it and do it.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"557000d363687254ff822800","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"the sun is warm, the grass is green, and i wanna kick that panda bear's ass","author":"50a843d47f123b2e7c001359"},{"id":"557005c86368726595e05600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I'm going to bed.","author":"505696b47f123b37e800effa"},{"id":"55700ae56368725e90200f00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"for a remix, this is pretty good\":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQD8tAQgk0","author":"50a843d47f123b2e7c001359"},{"id":"55701f566368725e90eb3900","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Urgh, my PC is so terrible that playing a game made it crash.","author":"4fe1b9f47f123b13df002976"},{"id":"557037586368720fa3c30200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@HJSDGCE\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55701f566368725e90eb3900#post_55701f566368725e90eb3900\r\n[bq=\"HJSDGCE\"]Urgh, my PC is so terrible that playing a game made it crash.[/bq]\r\nI hope it was wearing a seat belt hurrrrhurrrrhurr","author":"37e5b9d66361642500af5e00"},{"id":"5570448d6368724f19db0c00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I would like to ask.\r\nWhy is it that everyone wants to kill, capture, subdue, control, dispose or remake the Hulk?\r\n\r\nWhy can't they just leave him alone?","author":"4fe1b9f47f123b13df002976"},{"id":"557055346368724213770b00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Is anyone else able to access the Frienshipismagic.org forums?
