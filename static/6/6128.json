Context for 1st part: that Powerpuff girl episode where that neckbeard guy tried to like kidnap the powerpuff girls or w/e\r\n\r\n[spoiler]Like the villain of the episode, who trapped and kidnapped the girls to keep them all to himself, Bronies have to a large degree stolen the current generation of MLP from its original target audience by spamming the internet with child-unsafe mlp fan content, swamping appearances by creators and cast members with sketchy adults such that parents feel unsafe with their children there, and noisily attracting so much attention to themselves that it has distorted the nature of the show itself and especially its marketing.  ie, the MLP comic book, that is very much ‘by bronies for bronies’, an adult minded parody of the show’s characters rather than an adaptation that remains true to the style, spirit, or all ages nature of the source material.\r\nAnd as it has grown in influence, we’ve seen insensate brony screeching change from ‘its not just for little girls’ to ‘its not for little girls at all’.  We’ve also seen vicious, ugly, herd-mindset attacks on anyone within the fandom who dares to question the way the brony herd behaves at all, up to and including death and rape threats directed at said critics.  Far from being a ‘few bad apples’ situation, we’ve seen brony musicians making death and rape threats within their music go on to be invited to perform at brony conventions specifically because of how well received their hatred and bile proved to be within the community.\r\nMaybe Faust shouldn’t have been so supporting of the Brony community to begin with, and maybe show creators shouldn’t have gone out of their way to include explicit nods to them in the show and the marketing.  After all, bronies already liked the show and purchased the merchandise, pandering to them and encouraging them didn’t widen the show’s appeal.  Rather it just seems to have driven them to heightened levels of obnoxiousness and entitled possessiveness, and if anything they’ve in turn narrowed the show’s appeal.  They’ve certainly badly subverted its message, bringing a heavy dose of misogyny to the fandom of a show that was directed with all love and earnestness at young girls, and in doing so have brought down a cloud of ugliness and cynicism on what was so refreshing and engaging to begin with specifically for its openness and sincerity.[/spoiler] moocock","author":"37e5b9d66361642500af5e00"},{"id":"5555909d63687239815f1e00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Kaz\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/555590706368721993122900#post_555590706368721993122900\r\nIdk we need some controversy up in this thread, it's too politically correct","author":"37e5b9d66361642500af5e00"},{"id":"555590d463687235d8b23500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Kaz\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5555909d63687239815f1e00#post_5555909d63687239815f1e00\r\nWhat's this politically correct thing. !http://res.cloudinary.com/urbandictionary/image/upload/a_exif,c_fit,h_200,w_200/v1395991705/gjn81wvxqsq6yzcwubok.png!","author":"505696b47f123b37e800effa"},{"id":"5555914763687239811b1f00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Anybody up to something?","author":"5535e61d63687231ffb50a00"},{"id":"555591a76368727de8a94b00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"No I'm going to bed.","author":"505696b47f123b37e800effa"},{"id":"555591a96368720e47170000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Kaz\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/555590706368721993122900#post_555590706368721993122900\r\nGotta love good ol' hypocrisy.\r\nA woman doing things that are traditionally masculine?
