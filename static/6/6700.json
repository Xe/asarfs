I'm sorry about what I said earlier in this chat. (Before the 24 hour ban)\r\nI just got triggered into shit.[/bq]\r\nI wasn't around during the argument; all I know is that you said something negative about transgender people.\r\n\r\nThe thing is though here's my personal thoughts; the overwhelming super majority of transgender people aren't stereotypical; we're not insane or such, we're just regular people that are drastically uncomfortable with our bodies.\r\n\r\nTo use an analogy imagine if you were morbidly obese or such to the point that you can't walk; wouldn't you feel uncomfortable about your body and want to feel better about yourself so you can feel good about your body?  Now imagine if the only way you couldn't exercise or whatever to make your body into how you want it to be but instead had to resort to surgery?  To want to feel good about your body and be able to do the things you want to do isn't insane or such; it's just body dysphoria that you don't feel happy about yourself.\r\n\r\nTransgender is classified as a dysphoria and no longer classified as a mental illness; meaning that it's not a mental disease, it's more along the lines of you don't feel comfortable with your body and never will until you live the life you want to.\r\n\r\nTo continue to use the analogy let's say you weighed 500 pounds and had to use a electric wheelchair to get around; now imagine if every time you tried to exercise people pushed you back in the chair and told you it was unnatural for you to exercise and that you should just \"accept\" how you currently are rather than work towards trying to be how you want to be.  That is why it's not a mental disease, cause the people who have gender dysphoria just want to be happy with their body for once in their life rather than people constantly shoving them back into the electric wheelchair telling them that it's \"not natural\" for someone wanting to exercise to lose weight to feel good about themselves or people telling them that eating healthy is a \"mental disease\" and losing weight is morally wrong.\r\n\r\nI understand why people call it a mental disease, but it's more along the lines of you wanting to feel good about your body for once rather than just accepting what people predetermined what is \"best\" for you.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"55739fa36368724e9a001e87","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Shadow the Hedgehog\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55739d7c6368720dc5000a6a#post_55739d7c6368720dc5000a6a\r\nI was writing this post so I wasn't looking. Please understand.\r\n\r\nSo, I just want to let you know this; I'm very easily triggered like I just said, and when I get upset I tend to spew out a lot that I really don't mean in the long run. I actually don't care if someone's from a certain country or what their sexuality is. Thing is, what started it all was Quasar having to bring up an old thing I posted in another thread once and I wish he wouldn't had.\r\n\r\nYes, I reacted very poorly, I can't _not_ admit to that, because that would be flat out lying.\r\nBut you know what? Can we like, just move on and forget about everything ever and just start all over? Wouldn't it be better if we just stopped and thought for a minute? Arguing isn't going to make any of us feel any better. I know for sure I didn't feel good doing so. Yes, I had my thinking moments and realized what I did was fucking pathetic, but I really hate having to bring it up. I've never liked people pointing out my problems, that's also something I admit to.\r\n\r\nYou know, I think it's better if I just ignore people who comment on things from now on (and you should too!), because I'm tired as fuck of arguments.\r\n\r\n\r\nI put away my battleaxe now _for good._ I promise that from now on, if I don't behave just call me out on it, _because I said so_. I don't want to be a bad guy anymore, so I will finally give in and also apologize to Peregrine so we can lay this to rest. I'm very sorry about being so immature.","author":"5012e49c7f123b4012000341"},{"id":"55739fa66368725f600007e6","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55739f0e6368724e9a001da6#post_55739f0e6368724e9a001da6\r\nBut at least we got some good hits in right!
