Then at the end of the series wrap it all up with a plot arc about how the reason why everyone in the show is so horny, why there's so much fan service and that is because the everyone in the universe realizes that it's the end of the world and nobody wants to die a virgin and that people are only acting that way cause they know they're going to eventually die from the alien invasion.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5553dad06368727527870600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Carcass Strife\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5553d9af6368727781470400#post_5553d9af6368727781470400\r\nDO NOT MOCK YOUR KING!
