This game deserves A LOT more love but its just too obscure.\r\n\r\nEspecially for a Capcom title. So the game got berried under all the really popular titles like Devil May Cry and Resident Evil. \r\n\r\nI just wish the game would get like an HD release or even a Digital release because it is very expensive. \r\n\r\nHell I even love the game down to the Shitty voice acting.
