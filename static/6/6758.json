Like I said before, I can't decide personally. I'd argue that '06 reaches lower levels of crap IMO, but is pulled back up a bit by its good soundtrack. Boom offends me a bit less, but doesn't have much good to fall back on, the quality soundtrack that helps '06 barely survive is nonexistant in Boom.","author":"9ba2e84e636164642cc03200"},{"id":"55774c656368726ae3001176","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/557745ec63687272f1001ddf#post_557745ec63687272f1001ddf\r\n1st one was okay\r\n2nd one was shit\r\n3rd one i have no interest in","author":"4ffbfff37f123b072a01bb5b"},{"id":"55774ca4636872633100013d","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@EHAN\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55774a2d6368722c130013c5#post_55774a2d6368722c130013c5\r\nWell Jim \"Fucking\" Sterling Son did say the biggest thing hurting Sonic was that they just never tried to work on one game series, every new one was a complete departure so they never refined anything,","author":"509f70a87f123b77eb0004fd"},{"id":"55774cee6368724b1700030a","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"So guys, Dragon Ball Super.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"55774e046368725e5f000325","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55774cee6368724b1700030a#post_55774cee6368724b1700030a\r\nI can't wait to see what the hell they come up with that's stronger than super saiyan God super saiyan","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"55774e736368725e5f00039a","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55774e046368725e5f000325#post_55774e046368725e5f000325\r\n[spoiler]Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan 2.[/spoiler]","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"55774e99636872723700023c","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"goku a shit","author":"50a843d47f123b2e7c001359"},{"id":"55774f056368725e5f000461","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55774e736368725e5f00039a#post_55774e736368725e5f00039a\r\nYYEEEEEEEEEH","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"}]}
