The last couple of years all that has been really made is reality television, crime shows and probably the reason why the good shows like supernatural, korra, mlp and such have their own fanbases is that everything else sucks hard.  For every Gravity Falls there's 30 other shows that are live action high school settings where people sing about playing basketball instead of actually playing basketball.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53ae35086368720d8c610100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":">>6044t\r\nMind if I string you along?","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"53ae35526368720fea210200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"There should be a new _Jurassic Park_ park building game.","author":"50b70eeb7f123b1a02000097"},{"id":"53ae35876368720ebf2d0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Randomosaur\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53ae35526368720fea210200#post_53ae35526368720fea210200\r\n[bq=\"Randomosaur\"]There should be a new _Jurassic Park_ park building game.[/bq]\r\nThere's still a fanbase after jurassic park 3 and 2?","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53ae374d6368720d9c050200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"So I figured out how my programming teacher and everyone else got their programs to work when it was mathematically incorrect:\r\n!http://www.thedailysheeple.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/nuke.jpg!\r\nNo words in the English dictionary for this level of stupidity from him; just no utter fucking words can describe this level of stupidity.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't say I'm angry; more of a soul crushing depression that not only did no one catch that book error, but the fact that thousands upon thousands of people never thought to think it through and that thousands upon thousands of people thought that cause it was in the book that it was automatically correct.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53ae38c46368720d8c660200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53ae374d6368720d9c050200#post_53ae374d6368720d9c050200\r\nIs that the Czar Bomb?","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"53ae39936368720eab310300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SeraphimDawn\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53ae38c46368720d8c660200#post_53ae38c46368720d8c660200\r\nYes; as a matter of fact it is.\r\n\r\nThe whole reason why the program was wrong was that a format for a variable was put wrong.

And most fans enjoyed the second one, including me (but mostly for the San Diego _T. rex_ scene). I liked the third one too, it's a good dinosaur movie but can't compare to the first.\r\n\r\nThe are two park building ones already, one released in 2001 and the other in 2003. I've played the latter one before, and it is still my favorite game of all time.
