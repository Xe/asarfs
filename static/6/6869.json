Cannabis may be able to survive that sort of environment off the bat, but you can't survive off eating weed all day.\r\n\r\n2025-2040 will start mining operations of specific asteroids.  Some asteroids are rich with rare minerals and such that back home are expensive.\r\n\r\nOne theory as to why materials like gold, platinum and such are rare on earth is that they sink down and most of it is trapped in the earth's core.  Another theory is that the reason why the earth still has life is that not only do larger objects lose heat slower but that the earth's core is like a giant fission reactor.\r\n\r\nIf they find stuff like platinum on a asteroid then chances are the usa will shift drastically to a outer space minimum economy.  You'll probably see giant multi-corporation cooperative missions to mine asteroids.\r\n\r\nThe reason why I think this would be good is that such a industry would potentially be worth hundreds of trillions of dollars.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"557dfe626368727533000900","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/557dfd6463687275330007be#post_557dfd6463687275330007be\r\nDoesn't matter\r\nI'd go knowing I could probably die.\r\nIt'd be a helluva time","author":"54ff97db636872754d922f00"},{"id":"557dff7363687251b6003683","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/557dfe3f63687275330008d7#post_557dfe3f63687275330008d7\r\nWeed is such a versatile crop.

I got such utter shit for saying that the earth's core had fission going on even though it was scientifically backed and everything.\r\n\r\nThat's actually how I initially found out about the \"feels before reals\" crowd, cause I got in such shit over that cause my scientific evidence backing me got me into such utter deep shit that day.\r\n\r\nEven if a planet's core is dead it's not impossible to terraform it, the ecosystem would have to rely on extremophiles to keep the planet alive.\r\n\r\nTerraforming say Venus or such would take drastically more effort than mars though, cause you would have to dump a bunch of gases that cause cooling rather and then wait a couple hundred years for it to get cool enough for extremophiles then engineer them to give off both oxygen and cooling gas instead.\r\n\r\n\r\nTl:dr; to terraform mars just heat it up.  To terraform venus you would have to cool it then engineer extremophile bacteria to release greenhouse gases if it's too cold, but on the other hand release gases that cool the planet if it gets too hot but also eats those gases if the concentration is too high.\r\n\r\nTl:dr; terraforming mars is easy compared to other planets.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"557e030a6368727533000f92","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/557e029a6368727533000ed2#post_557e029a6368727533000ed2\r\nI know he's just a -squid- kid...\r\nBut he's kiiiiiind of grating.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"557e033763687217ba000930","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/557e030a6368727533000f92#post_557e030a6368727533000f92\r\nKids should not be announcers","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"557e036563687250040018f4","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/557e029a6368727533000ed2#post_557e029a6368727533000ed2\r\n\r\n\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/557e030a6368727533000f92#post_557e030a6368727533000f92\r\nBecause he's a Kid I'm refraining from getting Mad at him.\r\n\r\nKids trying so I'm just going give him Respect.
