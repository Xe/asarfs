I was going over some of the news on it and I thought of something; VR is going to cause a huge social change when it comes out.  I don't mean just for gaming or such, but you know how society's changed since the internet and how people don't go out as much anymore instead staying inside?  Yeah, imagine that but bigger.\r\n\r\nWhat I mean by this is that a actual study into the effects of VR on the brain is that it releases a much higher dopamine high than normal mass media and such forth to the point it's outright highly addictive.\r\n\r\nWhat is probably going to happen socially in the next ten years is you know how far less people are outside now than pre-mainstream adoption of the internet?  Imagine now where the extreme vast majority of people only ever go out for work/school/shopping.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm not going to say if this is good or bad because when you get right down to it a lot of social change is neither good or bad instead it just is.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53ab74286368727951380000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53ab73b26368727a4f160000#post_53ab73b26368727a4f160000\r\nI think its too early to really make a call on this, we haven't had any VR devices in mass release just yet.","author":"4f41ee04945b701c41002af7"},{"id":"53ab74696368727b4a370000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@gasmaskangel\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53ab73ac6368727cd3100000#post_53ab73ac6368727cd3100000\r\n\r\n\r\nconsidering how the guys got his car stuck there i woulnt be surprised if he had no pants.","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"53ab74d0636872799d600000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@gasmaskangel\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53ab74286368727951380000#post_53ab74286368727951380000\r\n[bq=\"gasmaskangel\"]\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53ab73b26368727a4f160000#post_53ab73b26368727a4f160000\r\nI think its too early to really make a call on this, we haven't had any VR devices in mass release just yet.[/bq]\r\nThe dopamine high from it though is on average more than double the dopamine high people get from mass media and video games though.\r\n\r\nTo use a analogy it's like introducing a pothead to crack.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53ab75716368727afd690100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I want a VR game where you can go to Jurassic Park.
