Imagine being able to live millions of years without fear of death and travel light years away.  After living millions of years wouldn't you get tired of that?  Not to mention if you were a synthetic being you wouldn't need to experience time the same in a 1:1 ratio; you could simulate a million years inside a simulation and live inside it for eons upon eons.\r\n\r\nSure you could try to advance to the point where even after the universe dies you could just pop into a new universe but what then?  Imagine living a infinite number of years.  Would you want to live that long?\r\n\r\nEven if you wanted to destroy the universe and successfully did so what would even be the point?  Sure you could destroy this universe, but there's theoretically at the very least 10^500 universes; if every particle in the universe represented a universe then the combined number of particles in the universe would still not be larger than that unit.  You could theoretically destroy this universe and nothing of significance happens; you could theoretically destroy a million million universes and it be of no importance, you could destroy a billion billion universes and it be of no importance.  Even if you could create a universe where everything is to your liking then it would be of no importance.\r\n\r\nIf nothing you ever did no matter how much power you garnered then what is the point in doing anything?","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53afb00c6368727b76820200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53afad0563687279761c0100#post_53afad0563687279761c0100\r\n\r\nBecause your decisions have consequences were the atoms that compose your body decided to form.\r\n\r\nMaybe they represent nothing for the other 10 x 10 ^500^ Universes, but it matters in this one.","author":null},{"id":"53afb26963687278d4f80200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Background Pony #E70B\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53afb00c6368727b76820200#post_53afb00c6368727b76820200\r\nThe problem with this is that when you get right down to it us humans do not matter to neither the other universes, this universe, this galaxy; only to our own planet.  Even if we were to destroy ourselves would it really change anything?  Honestly I think we are full of ourselves on multiple occasions.\r\n\r\nSome people say, \"Humans are going to reverse entropy\" or something like that but considering what that would mean that would be a terrible idea cause you'd be fundamentally altering the laws of thermodynamics and potentially killing billions of planets just to sustain one's self.  What I mean by this is that if you were to destroy entropy every time you lit a fire it would produce hiroshima and kill countless lives.  It would the equivalent of if someone thought destroying gravity was a good idea.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53afb34b6368727a03ef0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53afb26963687278d4f80200#post_53afb26963687278d4f80200\r\nNot to mention that altering the laws of the universe would be impossible.","author":"50b70eeb7f123b1a02000097"},{"id":"53afb3f76368727a62b70300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://img407.imageshack.us/img407/3328/decade.jpg!\r\nWhen Using Japanese pronunciation, Decade sounds like Dickhead (Dikeido) ...How appropriate","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"53afb48a6368727976110400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Randomosaur\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53afb34b6368727a03ef0200#post_53afb34b6368727a03ef0200\r\nCorrection: I doubt anyone's that stupid to try; exotic particles are extremely fucking dangerous","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53afb4e46368727ac0560400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53afb48a6368727976110400#post_53afb48a6368727976110400\r\nWell, if it is possible, then I want someone to mess with physics so I can go back to the Cretaceous.\r\n","author":"50b70eeb7f123b1a02000097"},{"id":"53afb6f263687254ff560000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Randomosaur\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53afb4e46368727ac0560400#post_53afb4e46368727ac0560400\r\nTrust me; if we're talking about the not-creating a parallel timeline universe time travel you wouldn't want to. . .\r\nLet's just say shit would get real.\r\n\r\nLike-\r\n!http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view2/1298026/2001-a-space-odyssey-o.gif!\r\n!http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view3/1771436/2001-space-odyssey-warp-o.gif!\r\n!http://37.media.tumblr.com/e7e16c29cda0865ba31aa5fb5da7cfb2/tumblr_n5ncpd3T9X1qkx7qpo3_500.gif!\r\n!http://filmgrab.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/56-old-dave1.png!\r\n-levels real.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53afb7966368725590c10000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"*Suddenly, A monster appears*\r\n\r\n*Sigh*\r\n\r\nWhy does this keep happening?\r\n\r\n*Takes out a card and inserts it into the belt*\r\n\r\n@Kamen ride!@\r\n\r\n@Decade!@","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"53afb79a6368725578840000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53afb6f263687254ff560000#post_53afb6f263687254ff560000\r\nI'm talking about creating-a-parallel-universe time travel.","author":"50b70eeb7f123b1a02000097"},{"id":"53afb8c863687256cbcf0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Randomosaur\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53afb79a6368725578840000#post_53afb79a6368725578840000\r\nOkay then; I was going to say.
