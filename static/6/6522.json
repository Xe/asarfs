Essentially the idea behind genre fatigue is that if a person watches too much of one genre most people eventually tire of that genre.  During the 1950's there was a lot of western movies; one western film per week in fact, by the time it hit the 1960's people were tired of westerns and moved onto other genres.\r\n\r\nThis is just my personal opinion, but they might be pumping out so many super hero films to squeeze out every last penny they can before people start getting sick of it.  To use an analogy the hype bucket is still half full; they're trying to take as much as they can before the bucket runs out of hype.\r\n\r\nThat also might explain why they're airing Doctor Who on disney channel now, why they bought star wars and are making a ghost in the shell movie; they're trying to see what is the next big thing.  If doctor who on their channel is popular and/or star wars makes a ton of money then chances are they're going to buy out a lot of science fiction franchises; they may buy out like star trek, I hope to god they'll buy Firefly and they might considering how popular it still is, etc.  On the other hand if ghost in the shell makes a lot of money they might buy out a lot of anime franchises and make movies.\r\n\r\nTl:dr; Disney is squeezing out as much money as they possibly can from people and are gauging what is the next big thing in films so that they can buy them all out before the competition can have the chance.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"556a3fa86368722308fb0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I fucking hate all of you right now.","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"}]}
