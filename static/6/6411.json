Technically, that's his title. His real name is Wally.\r\n\r\nBorn on an average farm at the floating islands in the sea of clouds of Asgard, Wally wanted adventure. To do so, he decided to travel to the dangerous lands of Terra (Midgard in his language). Before that though, he had to fill in some forms and papers, take insurance and wait for a while until the forms were approved. Then, he traveled to one of the Midgardian portals which were located at the shrines in which the Asgardians worship their great god. He traveled to Midgard (legalized since he filled the forms) and had many adventures. \r\n\r\nHe later returned, became High King, challenged the former king in battle for the throne of Asgard and lived a swell retired-adventurer's life.\r\n\r\nOdin (which is Wally) is a pretty swell guy. He does care for his people and rules the kingdom fairly. He has two children who always seem to argue. Thor, a mighty warrior with a powerful hammer that can shoot lightning. Thor is a bit of an arrogant man who looks down on people but he's pretty nice. Also, he doesn't like to admit defeat and if lost, he would cry easily. Loki is a trickster lady (yes, Loki's a gal) and likes to flirt with people and tease. Like Thor, she's actually nice and a bit mature compared to her brother.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe idea was that the main character met Odin and they had a good meeting and feast. After knowing how powerful Odin was, he challenged the High King to a battle. Everyone was against it but Odin agreed which he later chose not to have a spar since he would easily kill the lad. So instead, Odin proposed a race through the skies using VertiBirds, a species of weak but large birds that were given special bionic implants when they reach a suitable age. The Vertibirds are basically birds with jet engines and user interface.\r\n\r\nThor and Loki tried to sabotage the race so that Odin would win (they dislike Midgardians) but was later scolded for it.[/bq]\r\n","author":"4fe1b9f47f123b13df002976"},{"id":"5562dc856368722f697d0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@HJSDGCE\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5562dc536368721de5ae1100#post_5562dc536368721de5ae1100\r\nHe isn't on anymore dude.
