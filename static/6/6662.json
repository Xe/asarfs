I totally understand why some people feel like that cause they feel as though they're not ready for relationships or such, *but* the amount of complaining they do about people who do have sex and are interested in sex is irrational.\r\n\r\nIf you don't like sex whatever floats your boat, but I don't get why people feel as though they need to regulate people's sex lives.  If you don't like sex whatever, but a lot of people do like sex.  How are you supposed to stop people from having sex?  Cut their dicks off and mutilate women's vaginas?  If you did that then people would still have sex with dildos or such.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"557230456368723b93d51200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"2 am\r\n\r\ntrain leaves at 7 am\r\n\r\nbrilliant","author":"5007bbdf7f123b112f00023a"},{"id":"557230566368725777f22500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55722e556368725761a32600#post_55722e556368725761a32600\r\nI think the negativenreputatiin nuclearbpiwer has received is overblown. Nuclear power is the most efficient source of power out there. In resource and land scarce countries like japan where energy demands are high, nuclear is the way to go.

Just that they didn't expect a tsunami to cut their water supply off.","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"557230856368723b934c1300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@PaskaNaakka\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/557230456368723b93d51200#post_557230456368723b93d51200\r\n[bq=\"PaskaNaakka\"]2 am\r\n\r\ntrain leaves at 7 am\r\n\r\nbrilliant[/bq]\r\n~\"Just a small town girl\r\nLivin' in a lonely world\"~","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"}]}
