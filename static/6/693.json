What I mean by this is that philosophically speaking \"power\" in a metaphorical sense is a illusion that one has control over every possible situation to which often times the real world proves naught.  To expand upon this even if google goes comic book villain they would only have control over a very small portion of the internet and thus have very little actual control.\r\n\r\nWhile dangers of censorship and so forth are very real the problem with a lot of governments and companies is that they do it in a dumb ass way.\r\n\r\nTo use a recent example mainland china even though they forbid protesters from protesting a recent decision to shoot down democratization of hong kong 500k protesters showed up anyhow.\r\n\r\nDirect censorship is stupid cause you're spending fuck tons of money on only moderate results.\r\n\r\nA more sinister and more intelligent way of controlling people is through education; what I mean by this is that say you were a movie villain that wanted to control the world, the best way to do that would be through giving people education that they normally couldn't afford with biased books in your favor and college education in fields that would control things politically and/or in the courts and so forth.
