There's a terminology for this sort of thing; it's called cultural shift.  Parents will hate something new and geeky -> those kids will grow up into adults -> those now adults will then form the norm -> those adults will then have children and as a result solidify the new norm.\r\n\r\nTake things like DnD or such; back when it was first created parents rights groups called it satan worship, but those kids that played DnD became adults and as a result they formed the new norm.  The reason why comics, video games, anime and such are now considered mainstream is because kids that grew up enjoying those sorts of things are now adults and now have children.\r\n\r\nIt's considered perfectly normal to dress up as say Captain America or such for certain events and that cause that is the new paradigm because the kids that grew up on comics are now the norm for the usa.  The reason why DnD is considered normal is because kids that grew up playing it are now adults with children.  The reason why anime is becoming normal is that even though the mainstreaming of anime has only happened the last decade and a half those kids that were into anime and manga are for the most part adults.\r\n\r\nThe comic book industry is growing not cause \"comics are outgrowing nerds\", but rather those nerds have grown up and become adults and constitute the what is considered the norm for society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe logical fallacy of this article is that it forgets that children grow up.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo use a video game example of this: look at pokemon; the majority of pokemon fans are young adults because they grew up with pokemon and have continued to play pokemon therefore it's considered normal.  When pokemon first came out parent's rights organizations called it heathenism, accused it of promoting atheism because of the term \"evolution\" for the pokemon to the point that parents tried to create their own rip offs of pokemon to stop what in their minds was affront to their beliefs.\r\n\r\n*Tl:dr; that article is full of shit cause it ignores 99% of sociology.  Maybe you should read a fucking scientific paper once in a while instead of reading cracked OPINION articles and taking them as word of god.*","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"556007c6636872589ca00a00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@QuasarNova\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/556007216368721c788c2600#post_556007216368721c788c2600\r\nStill though, even today it's still some of the best CG animation you'll ever see.\r\n\r\nHell Advent Children has better animation than FROZEN.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"}]}
