It was really heavy and hard to move around. Those days, the Internet and computer was not as fast as today. \r\n\r\nI had a hard time (from my POV now) using the computer at home since it would take literally 7 minutes for the computer to start up. Also, the curved screens that made the computer had really weird lights at certain positions, especially if you look close enough. It just gives you a headache. \r\n\r\nIf you use the computer, you can't use your phone and the Internet at the same time. I remember when playing games at Miniclip or Cartoon Network and the connection jacked up because someone called the house phone. Sometimes, people just misdialed so the connection broke because of that. \r\n\r\nWatching videos was a pretty much a gamble since it takes so long for the videos to load and if the connection stops, you have to reload the entire page.\r\n\r\nAnd then, they were floppy disks. I kept games in those. The games weren't of great quality back then (usually just pixelated) and sometimes, the controls mess up, get stuck or just crash. Blue screens of death were more often. If the Internet isn't there, I just play with Microsoft Paint or just play that pinball game and solitaire that comes with the computer.\r\n\r\nSo yeah...","author":"4fe1b9f47f123b13df002976"},{"id":"55771232636872727d000d21","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"2000 computer fix.","author":"4fe1b9f47f123b13df002976"},{"id":"55771269636872475100007f","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/557711c16368721de400075c#post_557711c16368721de400075c\r\nI fucking want one!\r\n\r\nToo bad from what it sounds like its only for military purposes.\r\n\r\nGoddammit.
