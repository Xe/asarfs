I watched more Ninja Turtles as a child than I probably should have. And as much as I love them  I'm REALLY hoping this movie is a flop.[/bq]\r\nIt's a Michael Bay film; it's going to be a financial success.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn other news; it's been almost a month since I've started counseling.  I'm starting to realize just how dark my life's been and why people kept claiming I'm a \"good person\".  I don't normally talk about it, but I had always just assumed that life sucked that badly for everyone.  It's given me a bit of clarity though; a lot of times people's views on the world fall into the extreme generalization that either everything is good in the world with rainbows and kittens where nothing can go wrong or they view everything as wrong with the world.  I guess this mindset makes it easier to sleep at night when you think about it; if everything is wonderful according to a person then they don't have to feel as though they want to contribute back, if they feel as though everything is terrible then they can just go \"fuck you got mine\" and not have to feel as though contributing back.\r\n\r\nI'm starting to realize often times people spend ages searching for the \"truth\" in a situation for it to be right under their eyes in that if you don't spend the entire situation rationalizing you're viewpoints or beliefs on something the truth is right then there you go.\r\n\r\nWhat I mean by this is the reason why people spend their entire lives in search for truth in things is they spend their entire lives rationalizing that what they believe is true rather than actually look at a situation without any bias.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53acbe8b63687247b77d0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Randomosaur\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53acbe6f6368722bcf850100#post_53acbe6f6368722bcf850100\r\nOnly you Dino Nerd.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"53acbefd6368722b36cb0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53acbe396368722a686f0100#post_53acbe396368722a686f0100\r\nIs Blake just moody Twilight? \r\nI don't get that vibe but I fear the vibe","author":"4fe16df67f123b13e400003f"},{"id":"53acbf9b63687234a5990100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Whatevs\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53acbefd6368722b36cb0100#post_53acbefd6368722b36cb0100\r\nI'd say more moody X-man than moody Twilight.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"53acbfb06368722accaa0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Randomosaur\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53acbe6f6368722bcf850100#post_53acbe6f6368722bcf850100\r\nNope.
