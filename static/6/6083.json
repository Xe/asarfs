For decades in the usa anti-geeks made moral panics about geek culture and that; \"morality police\" called DnD a satanic ritual, in the 90's there was Jack Thompson and such.  With gamergate what was found out is that the overwhelming majority of \"video game journalists\" never touched the game they reviewed; instead it turned out a lot of them were political activists who used their position to push their political agenda.  That is why they shit on letsplayers like markiplier and jontron cause markiplier and such are actually gamers whereas they aren't and just watch videos of people playing the games instead.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reason why I bring this up is look at south korea; the usa actually has more gamers, nerds and geeks than south korea but south korea is so geeky that they have politicians cosplaying.\r\n\r\nWhy is south korea more geeky than the usa when we have more geeks?  Simple: cause of soccer moms, morality police and the such only exist in the usa.\r\n\r\n1970's: mainstream usa culture, \"geeks are worshippers of satan\"\r\n1980's: mainstream usa culture, \"geeks are worshippers of satan\"\r\n1990's: mainstream usa culture, \"geeks are worshippers of satan\"\r\n2000's: mainstream usa culture, \"OH FUCK!  GEEKS ARE GOING MAINSTREAM EVEN THOUGH WE KEEP CALLING THEM SATAN WORSHIPPERS!\"\r\n2010-2015: mainstream usa culture, \"TRY TO SHUT EVERYTHING DOWN!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRight now a lot of 24/7 news won't accuse geeks of being satan worshippers anymore or such cause simply put geek culture is far too profitable; if they tried that old shit again they would have to pay millions of dollars from Disney or such for slandering Star Wars or Marvel or such.\r\n\r\nBasically the soccer mom movement and the morality police movement when it comes to geek culture is finally dying.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTl:dr; soccer moms before around 2005: \"Geeks are satan worshippers\" -> modern day: large scale companies like Disney now own Star Wars and Marvel -> if soccer moms try to slander Star Wars they would get sued -> the anti-geek movement is dying because if they go up against geeks now they'll get their ass sued off by multi-billion dollar companies.\r\n","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5552b1256368724e59020000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"@Cutemon is cute@\r\n\r\n@:T@","author":"31bee2686368722a0df23600"},{"id":"5552b1366368722d55fc0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Say, what would happen if we took a bottle of coke, throw it into space (in which it won't explode or get destroyed, I mean) and aliens find it?\r\nWhat if the coke was shaken so once opened, would send out a fury of carbonated soda?\r\n\r\nWould we get into a war with extraterrestrial life due to coke?","author":"4fe1b9f47f123b13df002976"},{"id":"5552b13963687245a44c0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5552ae4f6368722b1f702200#post_5552ae4f6368722b1f702200\r\nGo back to yo grave.","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"5552b16f6368722d55490100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5552b0f66368722b1fff2600#post_5552b0f66368722b1fff2600\r\n@USA is fucked up@\r\n@Not surprised@","author":"31bee2686368722a0df23600"},{"id":"5552b1be63687243b64e0500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Gizoid101\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5552b1256368724e59020000#post_5552b1256368724e59020000\r\n!https://40.media.tumblr.com/adcd141ab44432a98feefb60e7fc7b25/tumblr_n6fodu0dXF1r1oesuo2_1280.jpg!\r\nHis name would be meaningless if he wasn't.\r\n\r\nAlso.
