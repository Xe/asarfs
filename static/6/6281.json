Don't get angry at me for someone else's actions.\r\n\r\nThe article may have talked poorly of gundam, but I never said that I hated gundam as well.\r\n\r\nReason why that would be incredibly douchy:\r\n\"The creator of something I love hates something else I love\" -> \"I'm going to get angry at the person who linked me to evidence cause if they linked me to a article that had a negative opinion on the franchise then of course the person who linked me to it must of course hate gundam as well\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the record I loved G Gundam and 08th ms team as a child.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo use an analogy that would be like getting upset at someone for pointing out how much of a fuckwit Joss Whedon is to Avengers fans and them getting angry at said person for Joss Whedon's individual actions.  It's like how people willingly admit that H.P. Lovecraft was a asshole, but love his books anyhow.\r\n\r\nThe creator of gundam may be a asshole, but the gundam franchise is easily one of the most iconic anime franchises.  Even in say fifty years chances are people will still remember the franchise.\r\n\r\nTl:dr; don't get angry at me for someone *else* hating gundam.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"555da8c86368723054d11100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/555da5b663687230548d0d00#post_555da5b663687230548d0d00\r\n...Wait a minute.\r\n\r\nTomino made Overman King Gainer.
