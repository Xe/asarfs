Basically the demo is out and Touhou may be known for being insanely difficult, but sweet baby jesus and the orphans!\r\n\r\nYou know the phrase \"busting my balls\"?  Well the latest game isn't just busting your balls; it's hitting someone in the groin with a jackhammer then grabbing them by the legs and ramming their nethers into a hardened diamond block hard repetitively.  Call me crazy, but I have a feeling when the full game comes out it might actually topple Ghosts 'N Goblins as the hardest game of all time cause if this is just the demo then holy shit the extra stage is going to be impossible.\r\n\r\n\"Protect me cone!\"\r\n!http://i.imgur.com/8FVT53s.gif!\r\n\"What is your problem with my balls?!\"\r\n\r\nTl:dr; Touhou just sailed right even asians think it's impossible to \"holy fuck!

Zun, the creator of Touhou, has lost his god damn mind with the difficulty level.\r\n\r\nHow insane is it?  Even Goku, Saitama and Superman would immediately get rekt is they had to fight this shit.
