Less worries about the government watching us like Big frickin Brother!\r\n\r\n\r\n...unless they have something else, cause we didnt even know about the Nsa stuff until it was leaked\r\n\r\n-molly.[/bq]\r\nThe problem with the nsa is that it's pretty much a failure cause the way they do it is stupid.  If it was prevented attacks then tell that to boston.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you want prevent regular crime the smart way of doing it would be to say take a map of the entire usa crime wise by district, put in all the times of the crimes and plug in the income rates for the areas.  It wouldn't give you a 100% accuracy but it would be accurate enough that you know that say a robbery is probably going to happen within a five mile radius between 10pm and 12am.\r\n\r\n\r\nA smarter way of preventing terrorist attacks is that there is actually threat detection software for cameras and that to detect if someone is potentially a threat in large crowds of people.  Hypothetically speaking at say a marathon you were to record it the software would list people by non-threatening to apprehend immediately.  It wouldn't be a 100% accurate, but if say something like the boston bombing were to be tried again it would set off like a million alarms.\r\n\r\nEssentially the way it works would be like:\r\n\"We've got a person hiding their face; threat level: suspicious\"\r\n\"He's walking towards a crowd of people; threat level: keep a eye on him\"\r\n\"He's placed a unknown bag on the ground and looks like he's wiring something inside it; threat level: send a officer\"\r\n\"He's leaving the site all together running pushing people out of the way and running from the officer; threat level: send a bomb squad\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI actually have known people who work in cyber security and want to know why he said they don't use the threat detection software?  No he actually admitted that it works and that it is effective and such; rather that it takes too much work.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"556b90a463687217fd2e0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/556b8b996368726097810000#post_556b8b996368726097810000\r\nThey'll just make it easier to acquire warrants then.","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"556b91d363687216871f0300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SeraphimDawn\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/556b90a463687217fd2e0100#post_556b90a463687217fd2e0100\r\nBetter for them to try to make getting warrants easier than for them to treat everyone like a terrorist.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"556b930f6368726e84630b00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I admit that while I love Saitama.
