The ropes (more like grappling hooks though) were stuck on a dismembered stone giant's finger, which was really big. Kinda like Kronos from God Of War 3, except more stone-like.\r\nApparently there was school in a warehouse, a teacher wearing a suit and glasses, and a cute girl with blonde hair, blue eyes, a hair clip and is slightly shorter than me. I think she's good with acrobatics. There were other people swinging ropes as well, maybe like the main transportation of the place.\r\nI was wearing a superhero mask for some unknown reason and I was insane. I jumped off that giant hand (it was really tall) and I would grappling hook myself across the giant's body with the trashy tall buildings. The girl would do the same.\r\nOne time, I would try to make a jump and I nearly missed the giant finger. I had to hold the finger like I'm some cat trying to climb a tree. The teacher would say that I couldn't do it but I went \"Fuck it, I fucking can!\" and just jumped onto it.\r\n\r\nThen everyone went to class and I think I woke up as the girl giggled a bit?","author":"4fe1b9f47f123b13df002976"},{"id":"55554bd6636872424fe00000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!https://m1.behance.net/rendition/modules/171718075/max_1200/9a4d88d92b18436a3274b32751ed3b93.jpg?cb=167735546!\r\n!https://m1.behance.net/rendition/modules/148116453/max_1200/59fb7e10e0862bf8f77304f83943977f.jpg?cb=167735546!\r\n!https://m1.behance.net/rendition/modules/162235931/max_1200/50e36071febd02061147240668028c79.jpg?cb=167735546!","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"55554c1c6368723b94a00100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/555549a26368724cbc9f0a00#post_555549a26368724cbc9f0a00\r\n[bq=\"mariomarc\"]I love video games based on game shows and shit\r\nBecause it's like, YOU COULD WHEN A MILLION DOLLARS AND THE GIRL OF YOUR DREAM\r\nOnly you don't[/bq]\r\n@There is a game called \"Vas or no Vas, con boletazo\" (Go or not Go) that is based in a game show where you can win by chosing cases with money@\r\n\r\n@But instead of money, you win tickets, which you change with things and stuff@","author":"31bee2686368722a0df23600"},{"id":"55554c3e6368721aa48f1100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Okay, Pat and Woolie singing Snake Eater is ADORABLE.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"55554c556368723b94f10100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Gizoid101\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55554c1c6368723b94a00100#post_55554c1c6368723b94a00100\r\nYou mean the TV show, Deal or No Deal?","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"55554c60636872424f950100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55554adb6368724cbc5f0c00#post_55554adb6368724cbc5f0c00\r\n[bq=\"trashboat\"]\"@Gizoid101\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/555549706368724cbc600a00#post_555549706368724cbc600a00\r\nMedabots.[/bq]\r\n@It looks like a digimon@","author":"31bee2686368722a0df23600"},{"id":"55554c62636872424f970100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55554c3e6368721aa48f1100#post_55554c3e6368721aa48f1100\r\n^it hurts my ears^","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"55554c966368726fac5f0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55554c62636872424f970100#post_55554c62636872424f970100\r\nThey're SUPER off key and neither of them actually sing for shit.\r\nBut it's still cute in it's own way.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"}]}
