For the longest time the theory for why that is was \"because glbt migrate to the city\"; well that theory got fucking shot down hard a while back cause nobody could show any level of evidence for it.\r\n\r\nGoing to Alfred Kinsey's initial studies on human sexuality something that a lot of people miss is that the \"14%\" figure isn't a measure of how many people identify as glbt, but rather sexual stimulation versus how current estimates put glbt population more at 2%.\r\n\r\nWhat do I mean all this?  The simplest explanation is that the drastic difference between the two figures isn't \"people are in the closet\", but rather the 12% difference is simply people that open to gay relationships.  To put it simply only a small fraction of the population is glbt, *BUT* a much greater percentage of people wouldn't mind being in a gay relationship.\r\n\r\nTo put it another way; there are gay relationships where one person is straight because they're only gay for that person.  What I mean by this is it's totally possible for someone to look at straight porn, be interested in women sexuality wise and still love his husband and find him sexually attractive and love to have sex with him.\r\n\r\n\r\nEven though it's been fifty years I still think the Kinsey scale still has some merit, cause if you're a 1 on the kinsey scale even though you're technically straight that means to some level you'd be open to a gay relationship.\r\n\r\nWhat does this have to do with San Francisco?  Simply put: maybe the reason why so many people are in gay relationships isn't because \"people are migrating to the city\" or \"3/20ths of the population are in the closet\", but rather those people don't give a metaphorical fuck about sexual identities and are just banging people they like instead?\r\n\r\nTl:dr; maybe human beings will bang anything?","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5585d33a6368723c4b002a8c","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"uc9 why do you call it glbt instead of lgbt","author":"50a843d47f123b2e7c001359"},{"id":"5585d3436368720af400238c","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5585d0d86368722c7f0029b4#post_5585d0d86368722c7f0029b4\r\n[bq=\"mariomarc\"]God damnit \r\nI wanna buy a vita P4G\r\n\r\nBut god damnit, I should be saving money \r\n\r\nBut I do have money to spare\r\nAnd I haven't bought anything else for a while now\r\n\r\n\r\nhmmmmm[/bq]\r\nI really wouldn't.\r\n\r\nYeah I know I'm biased and I know everyone knows I'm biased, *BUT* the vita was recently moved to legacy.

I may be biased towards pc, but yeah. . sucks to be you on this.\r\n\r\nSony is still having legacy support for it and there will probably continue to be *some* games new games for the next two or three years, but yeah it's like buying a ps2 now; ie buy it for games that are already out or games you know are coming out, not cause you think it's going to make a comeback.\r\n\r\nIt double sucks for sony fans cause if they've already put it on legacy without announcing a new handheld then it's pretty much official that sony has quit handhelds.
