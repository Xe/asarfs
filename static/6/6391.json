An example of what I mean by this is that when pokemon first came out religious groups tried to make a christian card game to cash out on pokemon's popularity and trying to use pokemon like card games for religious profit.\r\n\r\nLess people trying to upvote whore cause the majority of the artists are there cause it's a hobby.\r\n\r\nLess costumers e-begging for money cause the majority of them it's a hobby and they're not trying to create a living off making cosplay costumes but rather cause they like to cosplay.\r\n\r\n*WAAAAAAAYY* less people trying to start fights over sexual orientation; as in considerably less people that try to push gays out of fandoms cause glbt are considerably more accepted than most fandoms.\r\n\r\n\r\nTl:dr; look at deviantart comments on artwork vs say a porn site's comments on artwork.
