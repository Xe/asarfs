The closest scenario is Hillary ONLY winning 60% of the general election and ONLY winning at least 300 electoral votes.  That's a extreme bias in Republican's favor though.  The most realistic scenario though is she'll more than likely win nearly 400 electoral votes.  The scenarios get worse when you calculate in potential Republican contenders in the caucuses and how in all probability the Republican candidate will win big with conservatives but be totally unelectable in the general election.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you're wondering where I'm going with this:  Hillary in 2016 will win anywhere from 300 electoral votes to 450 depending on who she's running against.\r\n\r\nTl:dr; 2016 R.I.P.

While conservatism is weak in the US now, it won't be forever. It will make a comeback, probably before the decade is out though it taking longer is certainly not impossible.\r\n\r\nNow, whether or not the republicans are still the face of American conservatism I can't say, though frankly we're long past due for a political upheaval of this magnitude.\r\n\r\nOf course all of this is predicated on the idea that there will be a spontaneous erosion of voter apathy in the next few elections, so ultimately who can say?\r\n\r\nFuck there is still time for a massive upset to come along in the upcoming one, but whether one happens or not I know one thing: 2015 is going to hurt me.","author":"4f41ee04945b701c41002af7"},{"id":"53b3a1506368723dd99a0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@gasmaskangel\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53b3a0d66368721173470300#post_53b3a0d66368721173470300\r\nthe Lbbrerals have gone prttyty far.
