What I mean by this is that have my game essentially and if another company wants to they can build off top of it for profit.\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you think this could work?  Cause it could save companies a lot of money if they just built their games off top off mine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou know how call of duty all their games are simply rehashes of the previous game?  What that would essentially do is allow other companies do that as well.  Obviously if it's successful there's going to be companies that abuse this and simply make their games a retexture of mine, but people already do that anyhow in the industry anyhow where their current game is simply a rehash of their older games.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53af941763687253c6b00100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"An evolutionary biologist gets mail.\":http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2014/06/28/i-get-email-8/ (The first email is hilarious)","author":"50b70eeb7f123b1a02000097"},{"id":"53af941e63687253b3890100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53af93256368725400830100#post_53af93256368725400830100\r\nI woudn't know\r\n\r\nIf they made a Marvel vs. capcom style Kamen rider Fighting game, What would you like the other license to be?

The devil is created by the god of the story(not a specific religion's god; side note: all the characters are female) and that her fall is because she loves god too much and as a result sees how much shit her mom gets for things she never did and tries to get rid of humans not cause she wants to take over anything, but because she sees how much people hurt her mom and wants them to stop hurting her and is willing to do anything and go to any extent to do so which starts the story.  The story starts in that she just goes apeshit after someone almost kills her mom and starts a infection that is essentially zombies(specifically regenerative, smart, slow, spitters that hocking a loogey at people is how they infect you[just take a huge spit and spit disease infected booger in your face]).\r\n\r\nCall it a cop out, but I honestly want to keep the rating as low as possible by instead of using guns using magic and such.  The other cop out is that at the end the cure doesn't necessarily 100% cure people rather gives them back their mind and makes them no longer able to infect people so I can go \"Oh no one actually died\" cause if everyone that dies just constantly regenerates and at the end of the story they come back anyhow when the ESRB tries rating it I can just go, \"No one died so can't give me a M rating LoL\".[/spoiler]\r\nBasically the story in a nutshell is someone tries to hurt the antagonist's family so the antagonist goes apeshit after seeing their mom almost die before their eyes and she never intended for the fallout of their actions to get that bad.  Less of a pure evil antagonist and more of a \"I dun fucked up!  I really dun fucked up!\" antagonist that makes one split second bad decision that spirals out of control.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53af97ae6368725479010300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53af964a63687253c6960200#post_53af964a63687253c6960200\r\nI'd be an anthro _T. rex_ with a Darwin fish stamped on his chest and wielding an ear of GMO corn with a shark's mouth on it.\r\n\r\nAlso, my finishing move would be beating my opponent to death with my giant flexible hemipenes.","author":"50b70eeb7f123b1a02000097"},{"id":"53af97c963687253c61b0300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"So I was watching Pacific Rim for the 6th time this week and I noticed something that was kind of really awesome.
