I think they're realizing that gay marriage is probably going to be legalized now and Scott Walker is trying to push a constitutional amendment to allow gay marriage bans; the problem with his logic is obvious in that the supreme court only has a couple weeks to decide on gay marriage.  Even if congress were to push for such a thing as fast as they possibly can it legitimately would not get passed fast enough to stop gay marriage at this point.\r\n\r\n\r\nCongress still hasn't managed to pass any bills to allow dragnet warrant-less spying on citizens.  I don't want to get hopeful but warrant-less spying might be dead for good; the longer in-between the time the patriot act expired and the point at which they get a bill put through congress the harder it will be to re-pass warrant-less spying.  The reason being is supporters of warrant-less spying said for years that the second the patriot act expired that there would be another 9/11 and the longer time between the patriot act and another bill the more and more people are going to realize that's a crock of shit and thus reduce support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso looking at 2016 election:\r\nHillary may be a metaphorically dead on arrival president.  At this point it's pretty obvious that Hillary is going to win the election, but not enough to have a super majority democrat congress and the thing about presidents is that their first two years are when they are the most active.  Essentially she'll be able to pass not controversial bills cause she'll have enough democrats in congress to do so, but not enough to do anything too liberal.\r\n\r\nNon-controversial things like equal pay bills or such will definitively pass, but if you're hoping for stuff like criminal investigations of wall street or such it's probably not going to happen.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5574bea363687277680018c6","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"...I just noticed how quickly I reply or post on threads around here.","author":"515ddf93a4c72d8a1f000d57"},{"id":"5574c1976368727768001d63","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"Macarena\":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiBYM6g8Tck","author":"509f70a87f123b77eb0004fd"},{"id":"5574c29a63687207630000a1","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Princess♠Molestia\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5574bad963687257c40003a5#post_5574bad963687257c40003a5\r\n[bq=\"Princess♠Molestia\"]\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5574b8506368720539000eb2#post_5574b8506368720539000eb2\r\nWe were at one point.
