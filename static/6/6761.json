Like legitimately interesting.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou know how politicians constantly spout \"women earn less than men\"?\r\nI was elsewhere on the net and someone made a interesting point \"if women earn less than men wouldn't that cause companies to hire them more than men?\"\r\n\r\nI'll summarize since I have to take a exam in two hours and I need to get some last minute cramming in.\r\nShort version is that the pay gap is miniscule at higher paying jobs; the reason for the pay gap is that women get hired much more than men at low income jobs.  If you have ever worked at a shitty walmart that fucks over employees you know what I mean.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to low paying jobs companies prefer first undocumented workers at the top of the hiring pole then women then men.\r\n\r\n\"Well how do we close the income gap?\"\r\n\r\nThat's where changes in the workforce come in.  By 2025 70% of minimum wage or lower jobs will be eliminated.  There will still be need for plenty of workers; it's just jobs like janitors or such will be eliminated entirely.  The reason why this helps both undocumented workers and women is that since those minimum wage jobs will be eliminated they will be hired instead for higher paying jobs.\r\n\r\nIf any politician in the next ten years says, \"I'm responsible for the higher quality of living for undocumented workers/women\" they are utterly 100% full of bullshit.\r\n\r\nIn 10 years time the cost of living will be significantly down due to inventions like 3d printing houses, 3d printred vehicles, 3d printed organs, reprogramming cells, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nTl:dr; over the course of the next ten years the majority of low paying jobs will be eliminated and the cost of living will go drastically down and *ANY* politician that says they're responsible is full of shit.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5577940563687205f0000674","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@PaskaNaakka\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5577939b63687238e00002f6#post_5577939b63687238e00002f6\r\n>birds 24/7\r\ni'd rather be in hell","author":"50a843d47f123b2e7c001359"},{"id":"557794236368725cf2000fcd","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Thank you YouTube wii u app for bugging the fuck out and leaving the image of a faceless man pointing straight at me for several seconds for no apparent reason","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"5577943c63687205f00006cf","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/557794236368725cf2000fcd#post_557794236368725cf2000fcd\r\n[bq=\"Too_Offensive\"]Thank you YouTube wii u app for bugging the fuck out and leaving the image of a faceless man pointing straight at me for several seconds for no apparent reason[/bq]\r\n8 pages","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"557794a263687238e000045d","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5577943c63687205f00006cf#post_5577943c63687205f00006cf\r\nNah, nah, this one had black holes for eyes","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"5577954e63687205f000084a","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/557794a263687238e000045d#post_557794a263687238e000045d\r\n[bq=\"Too_Offensive\"]\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5577943c63687205f00006cf#post_5577943c63687205f00006cf\r\nNah, nah, this one had black holes for eyes[/bq]\r\nHis eyesight must suck.","author":"5007bbdf7f123b112f00023a"},{"id":"5577954f6368725e77000305","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/557793a1636872514d00106c#post_557793a1636872514d00106c\r\nThat argument is actually pretty old.
