But really I'm sure factories will find a purpose somewhere by being more efficient than printers for very large amount of units.[/bq]\r\nThe problem when you think about it is adding in transportation costs though.  Why manufacture <x> when you can make it at the local hub?  What I mean by this is why manufacture a broom in china and transport it all the way to the usa or europe or such when you can manufacture it at the local walmart distribution center saving tons of money on transportation costs?  Conservatively speaking this is going to cost 20-30 million jobs globally within the next decade or so; that's the low bar estimate though and you have to remember factoring in that oil prices are just going to constantly go up, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nI don't think it's going to kill the manufacturing industry over night, rather in say fifty years traditional factories will be dead.  If you have a job at a factory don't worry, we're talking decades.  You won't have to worry about this for a couple decades.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53b0ba6163687211d2250200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SeraphimDawn\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53b0b8c3636872783a390000#post_53b0b8c3636872783a390000\r\nOne part says it's good enough to stand on its feet.
