In the EU neuroscientists are getting death threats for experimenting on apes and having to double down by experimenting on rats.  In the long run basically the EU is fucking themselves, because in say 10-15 years that means they'll be so far behind they legitimately won't be able to catch up.\r\n\r\nYou know how overwhelmingly the majority of computer parts aren't made in europe and instead say stuff like, \"this part was made in taiwan\", \"this part was made in the usa\", etc?  Yeah; that's going to happen with implants as well.\r\n\r\nEssentially the problem with cybernetic development in europe, \"Let's send death threats to neuroscientists! . . Oh shit!  Why are we falling behind technology wise?!\"\r\n\"@Albus Fahrenheits\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/555474856368723a0f822e00#post_555474856368723a0f822e00\r\n\"Experimental eye implant prototypes are already in production\":http://news.rutgers.edu/feature/news-bionic-eye-implant-mayo-clinic-surgeon-rutgers-alumnus-goes-viral/20150419","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"555476f66368725b7eb40c00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/555475fd6368724202cf1200#post_555475fd6368724202cf1200\r\nSoldier: Good news!

A lot of people still use Windows XP and Microsoft has been trying everything under the sun to get them to upgrade but they won't.  The problem with windows 8 is that cause windows 7 wasn't pretty okay that caused windows 8 to be dead on arrival; no matter how many discounts they offered it was dead on arrival.
