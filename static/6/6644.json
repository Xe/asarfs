But sadly his wife had passed away after giving birth, and even worse, The Baby had shortly _died_ afterwards. This is why he adopted Timmothy.\r\n\r\nWell years go By as Timmothy grows older, And with his Fathers intense teachings he has also grown Stronger. Meanwhile on the news It has been confirmed that a new _deadly_ disease has been discovered and many people around the world have been dying from it.\r\n\r\nWhile these years go by it also has been discovered that Ancient beings (Monster animal people) have been also discovered. And some of them are dicks and really dangerous. So at this point the human race is getting nothing but bad luck.\r\n\r\nWell after years of Training Timmothy's training is complete. He is 34 years old and his Master is proud of him. But sadly, His Master is extremely ill.\r\n\r\nAnd After his training his master tells him he has the disease and sadly passes away a few months afterwards. \r\n\r\nMeanwhile people are still trying to discover HOW to beat the disease AND How to handle the Monsters. Well, someone took a moment and thought.\r\n\r\n\"How come the monster's aren't sick?\" Well it turns out that the monsters are _immune_. SO PEOPLE START GOING NUTS!\r\n\r\nAnd try to get the blood of the beasts! Well it turns out that it doesn't work, It isn't possible for the Blood to work as a cure, Plus its pretty difficult to obtain as well. So what now? Is the human race finished?\r\n\r\nNot so! It is possible that the way to continue, is to mate with these beasts and have children, as the DNA and genetic change will be able to beat out the disease. \r\n\r\nThat's right, The Next generation is the cure. Buuuut that's easier said than done since these beastmen and women wouldn't touch the Human race with a ten foot poll...Unless...You beat them in battle. Showing that maybe your race shouldn't be taken lightly!\r\n\r\nWell again easier said than done since nobody can fucking beat them!\r\n\r\nWell, until now.\r\n\r\nOne day Timmothy is strolling along and suddenly his town gets attacked by a Dragon Beast Woman! Picking on the towns folk and ransacking the place.\r\n\r\nTimmothy (Being the good guy he is) cannot stand for such insolence! (Plus this is like the day after his father died) So he screams at the top of his lungs. \"I HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS\" To the beast\r\n\r\nAs she exclaims, sounding like a rude child, \"Well now, We seem to have a tough Human hmmm? DONT MAKE ME LAUGH! What would you, A lesser Being like you do to a Perfect being like me!\"\r\n\r\nFucking pissed off our Hot blooded hero gets into an Epic fight using the Martial Arts his master taught him!\r\n\r\nHe kicks the Crap out of her!\r\n\r\nStunned at what has happened she just stays on the ground in the _crater_ he put her in. \r\n\r\n\"...\" she has nothing to say to him.\r\n\r\n\"...\" He has nothing to say to her.\r\n\r\n*Next Day* \r\n\r\nTimmothy wakes up, to an intruder in his home, Eating his food! \r\n\r\nPissed off he finds out its the Dragon girl from yesterday. \r\n\r\n\"You beat me in battle\"\r\n\r\n\"And?\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean and?\"\r\n\r\n\"???\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm here to give you my body Dammit! Don't make it Awkward! Now hurry up and lets get this over wi-Where'd He go\"\r\n\r\nShe looks for hours for this man before she finds him cowering in fear.\r\n\r\n\"What is up with you?! You kicked my ass yesterday and now you are cowering in fear now!\"\r\n\r\n\"You do know if You knock me up You can SAVE YOUR RACE Right?!\"\r\n\r\n~\"I know...But\"~\r\n\r\n\"But what?\"\r\n\r\n~\"I'm scared of Sex\"~\r\n\r\n*Timmothy is is a Virgin and at the same time too shy to fuck anyone* \r\n\r\nSo throughout the whole rest of the story Timmothy gets into fights with these monsters because he's a hotblooded Hero but at the same time Doesn't feel like sleeping with them.\r\n\r\nAnd As time goes by the amount of Monsters/Beasts that will give him their bodies Stacks up!\r\n\r\nAnd these beasts haven't had sex for a long ass time man and they want his fucking Dick but Timmothy is to shy to get it up!\r\n\r\nEVEN DUDE BEAST MEN WANT TO FUCK HIM! BUT HE DOESNT WANT ANY OF IT!\r\n\r\nHE'S TOO SCARED! *FUCK THE BEAST CHICK TIMMOTHY OR YOUR RACE WILL _DIE_*\r\n\r\nMain Characters are Timmothy, The Dragon Girl, And some other Humans and beasts along the way.\r\n\r\nOne of which is a poor Crippled girl that has catched the disease and has had it for years now, but she keeps going regardless.\r\n \r\nAnd the Story gets interesting as Timmothy slowly falls for the Dragon Girl but She's too much of a hard head to realize she loves him too. And he's too much of a stubborn mule to admit it.\r\n\r\nIts an Action Comedy that has heart felt moments and a cast of weirdo's and (Maybe) inspirational characters. \r\n","author":"50c204917f123b31440000a5"},{"id":"557190fa6368722c2bc61000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Guess it is thread nap time already.","author":"4fdef063945b700a9d01604f"}]}
