I don't mean that in the traditional sense, rather I mean companies, organizations, governments and so forth need to put on their big boy pants and realize not everyone is kissing their feet.\r\n\r\nA prime example of what I mean by this is how there's even governments or militaries now that view twitter as a form of warfare (cough) ISIS, Israel and sometimes the usa and so forth (cough) . . . Come on guys if you had called it propaganda then I could see that, but equating it with living and dying on the battlefield?\r\n\r\nAnother prime example is how a lot of companies will now sue people if they have a negative review of their products. . . Come on guys; it's the internet.  The internet is basically filled with cats, porn and anger.  What's worse is that there is a entire industry dedicated to finding negative reviews on the internet and either trying to sue them or going on internet forums and be a shill to try to bury their opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a feeling fifty years our generation and potentially previous generations are going to be characterized as a giant baby throwing a tantrum cause someone said something mean to them.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53b4a8a46368726671010300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53b4a0f06368726654fa0000#post_53b4a0f06368726654fa0000\r\nI see your point, and I agree with it to an extent, but frankly right now the world is a giant baby throwing a tantrum. Its easy to forget that the internet and social media are very, very young compared to most things that have defined culture and people are still adjusting.\r\n\r\nBoth government and corporations will take an even longer time to adapt and grow into things because by their natures neither one encourages personal responsibility beyond whoever gets stuck with the metaphorical check and even then they are likely to view it as someone else's problem dumped in their lap.\r\n\r\nThings will change eventually but it is a slow, gradual process, though it is faster than most might think.","author":"4f41ee04945b701c41002af7"},{"id":"53b4b5066368723f535b0300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"To cringe, laugh, cry or all at the same time?\":http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/01/04/trestin-meacham-gay-hunger-strike_n_4540369.html?utm_hp_ref=fb&src=sp&comm_ref=false","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"53b4b8e96368725f5ccb0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"'Fox News rips off BioShock Infinite logo, Irony ensues.'\":http://www.avclub.com/article/fox-news-rips-bioshock-infinite-logo-irony-ensues-206519","author":"4fe4bf947f123b175b000001"},{"id":"53b4ba6b636872409cce0500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@AaronMk\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53b4b8e96368725f5ccb0000#post_53b4b8e96368725f5ccb0000\r\nOH JESUS IT FINALLY HAPPENED","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"53b4bab563687248a1150100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53b4ba6b636872409cce0500#post_53b4ba6b636872409cce0500\r\n\r\nTHEY ONLY WISH THEY COULD BE FATHER COMSTOCK.","author":"4fe4bf947f123b175b000001"},{"id":"53b4babf6368721813a50400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"So I just got back from my Grandfather's retirement party.
