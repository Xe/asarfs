People are already rejecting the woman's sex drive pill.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo offense to anyone that describes them as \"liberal\" or \"democrat\", but when it comes to certain medication liberals sure aren't liberal when it comes to medication.  Right now they're slowly finding medication to treat sexual diseases and complications and the current generation is rejecting it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat just kind of how things are when you think about it: young ones start off calling themselves liberals but then when they become adults and they constitute the new norm the paradigm shifts and as a result they become conservative.\r\n\r\nBasically:\r\nWhen people are young, \"Smash the 'man'!\"\r\nWhen they get old, \"Stop the whippersnappers before they change society anymore!\"\r\n\r\nMy guess is that 20-35 year old currently in say twenty years will be anti-medicine, anti-biomechatronics, anti-synthesized organic matter, etc, etc and that will probably become the new social issue of people wanting cures for say cancer, aids or such to be criminalized for being \"unnatural\".","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"55753a6b6368727881004b04","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5575399a63687213ff000e82#post_5575399a63687213ff000e82\r\nwhy would anyone reject a chicks version of viagra, it seems harmless enough to me","author":"50a843d47f123b2e7c001359"},{"id":"55753af46368724da0002b98","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@hype\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55753a6b6368727881004b04#post_55753a6b6368727881004b04\r\n[bq=\"hype\"]\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5575399a63687213ff000e82#post_5575399a63687213ff000e82\r\nwhy would anyone reject a chicks version of viagra, it seems harmless enough to me[/bq]\r\nCause they think it's morally wrong. . . sound familiar?\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonally I think in say 20 years they'll have cures for all the stds, stuff like cancer, able to regrow limbs and that but people that are currently in the 20-35 year range will reject it and be riddled with disease whereas young adults then hiv will be practically unheard of.\r\n\r\n\r\nDisgusting side note:\r\n[spoiler]\r\nYou know how in old folks homes there's a disgusting smell all the time?  That smell is the smell of people getting all sorts of contagious diseases that are preventable.

Old folk home smell is the smell of gonorrhea, syphilis and stuff like that.\r\n[/spoiler]","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"55753bdf63687267af001640","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Sleep is the best kind of lunch.","author":"4fdef063945b700a9d01604f"},{"id":"55753c306368727881004f4a","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5575399a63687213ff000e82#post_5575399a63687213ff000e82\r\nWhat pill?
