Space travel; think about it for a second the reason why space travel is so expensive is that for every kilogram it costs thousands of dollars to get it in space.  With fusion we'll be able to have deep space manned exploration missions; granted we're talking astronauts being in space for potentially decades, but still within the realm of possibility.  The reason why we have never had a astronaut go to mars is that it would be insanely expensive for everything and to shielding thick enough to block out the radiation.  With fusion reactors that would make it far more realistic.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53b4f2616368723955240300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53b4f12d6368723955c80200#post_53b4f12d6368723955c80200\r\nYOU BIT OFF THE DICK HALF OF MY BODY!","author":"50b70eeb7f123b1a02000097"},{"id":"53b4f2e56368725dcccc0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Randomosaur\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53b4f2616368723955240300#post_53b4f2616368723955240300\r\nNo wonder why it was so floppy.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"}]}
