What I mean by this is that a lot of companies are actually in the process of returning to the usa because of technological reasons.  Foxconn is currently in the process of moving back to the usa not cause of anything anyone did, but because they're replacing 90% of their workers with robots.  The reason why they don't just make the robots in china is not bashing china, but we're kind of more advanced in that sense.\r\n\r\nWe have a entire industry devoted towards the production of adaptive robots that can assemble parts when the parts are mismatched or so forth, china on the other hand does not have this industry to the extent that companies can realistically just develop these robots in china.  They would have to import the robots and every single time one breaks either export it back to the states or have a extremely specialized technician come to china to fix it.  Let's face it if you had to transport any time a broken robot clear across the globe or constantly put technicians on the plane and send them to fix them that's not worth it.\r\n\r\nIt's far cheaper to just have the robots in the states that way you don't have to constantly fly out thousands of technicians just to fix little things.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53b0affd6368724426c40100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53b0aeed63687242deda0100#post_53b0aeed63687242deda0100\r\nI agree.
