Sold.\"  Unfortunately a lot of sonic games have been shitty the past decade; only about 3 have been decent.

I still prefer the original roller, and I'm not even a fan of the Kraken Roller either, I like the Wailer special more.\r\n\r\nI think the most OP in Turf War right now is pretty much any charge shot weapon, at least in the Walleye Warehouse, because we got absolutely demolished by one guy who stood on top of the boxes where nobody could shoot him. He got 17 kills in one match just by hanging way up out of reach of everyone, while the rest of his team kept us held back normally.

People were getting arrested at conventions, site admins were doing illegal shit, attempted murder case; a lot of serious shit happened in that era.  Most of the furry hatedom nowadays is a bunch of whiners that don't understand why the hatedom originated.  It was so bad back then the fandom almost split in two one year but didn't because the people trying to split off were idiots that couldn't keep their mouths shut.\r\n\r\nIf you are a furry eventually the hatedom will go away dude; it's just with how much shit went down during that era it's taken years for the majority of the people doing illegal shit to get jailed and there are still some of those people running around free.  If you think this is bad you have no idea what it was like.  When I rejoined fa I was legitimately shocked at how little drama there currently is versus back then.\r\n\r\nIf you want the hatedom to go away then just keep in mind that on average people are only in that fandom for less than five years so most of the people responsible for all that shit during that era are gone, in say five years the fandom will be just another fandom and the amount of drama will be negligible vs the past and as a result the hatedom will vanish as well.\r\n\r\nTl:dr; the hatedom originated from the 2000-2005 era; serious shit went down in that era, fortunately most of the people responsible for that have left or got arrested, in say five years the hatedom will be gone because the people responsible will have left.\r\n\r\nTl:dr of Tl:dr; if you think modern furry drama is severe you have *NO* idea how bad it used to be.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"556a847c63687243021b3200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/556a84276368727f40ce2600#post_556a84276368727f40ce2600\r\nBut you're killing them when they spawn, aren't you?","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"556a84df6368727f409d2800","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"And did anyone notice that Spyke has an accent?","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"}]}
