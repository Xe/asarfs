Their uses are limited cause they can't make metal objects!  It will never happen and that's a scientific fact!\"\r\nI mean where the fuck do I even begin with something this incredibly fucking retarded?  They've been 3D printing metals for over a year and are working on making jet engines and cars out of 3D printed metals.  I know that 3D printing is slower, but it's more designed towards bringing down costs on expensive items; you'll still have your factories for say plastic cups, but 3D printing say a life size pvc anime figure would cost 1/10th the normal price.\r\n\r\nEveryone's entitled to their opinions and such, but don't go \"I have a college degree in everything and I know everything!\".\r\n\r\nI don't ever say fabricated bullshit like \"I have a doctorate in physics\", cause that would be complete bullshit; I just like physics as a hobby, but my actual college degree is in advertising; if I were to say that I have a college degree in physics that would be complete bullshit.\r\n\r\nEh; just the whole \"I have a college degree in everything!\" crowd on internet blogs annoys the fuck out of me.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"556a209963687259a8542a00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/556a1fc86368723760373500#post_556a1fc86368723760373500\r\nWell if your there at night then at least you can see allot of pretty lights,","author":"509f70a87f123b77eb0004fd"},{"id":"556a20c76368723786513200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Thanotos Omega\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/556a1f816368723786ce2f00#post_556a1f816368723786ce2f00\r\nThats basically what I'm getting at.
