I still think their dog piling and lynch mobs are going to be problems down the road.","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"5581fee163687221b90002af","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5581fdd063687221b900014b#post_5581fdd063687221b900014b\r\nPeople tend to think that everything in the Mons genre is a pokemon clone.
