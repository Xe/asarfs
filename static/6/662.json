Aegis is likely to happen in the next two decades because you'll have a core Ai base, core program base and they'll grow into their own distinct personality and so forth.  They'll start with barely a personality then grow into it.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53afd3436368720d11ea0300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Number1pegasus\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53afd1b16368720d662a0300#post_53afd1b16368720d662a0300\r\nMomotaros: ...We...Have arrived","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"53afd3d86368720e84480400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53afd2626368720d9b5b0300#post_53afd2626368720d9b5b0300\r\nOh cool!
