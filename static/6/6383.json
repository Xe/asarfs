Never been the biggest X-men fan. It does that thing that I don't like in writing. Instead of developing the characters that have already been established and using that to push the plot it just introduces new characters and further clutters the series. X-men has the exact same problem as Bleach.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"556240276368727ba0463600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55623f166368725d5a000900#post_55623f166368725d5a000900\r\nTo be fair it's less of a series that is part of a bigger series and more of a standalone series as a introduction for people that have never watched it.\r\n\r\nOne of the biggest problems with the superhero genre is tv shows or movies that assume you already know everything about the franchise; when in reality if you throw every character and the kitchen sink at people that have never seen anything related to it all at once they don't get excited, rather they just get confused as fuck.\r\n\r\nThat's why the majority of current Marvel movies are so good is because you don't need a Phd in comic book history to understand the story.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"556240c06368726c015f0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Damn I really feel like Commissioning someone.\r\n\r\nBut 1) Got no Money, 2) don't have a Paypal (Though after recent events Paypal kinda scares me) ","author":"50c204917f123b31440000a5"},{"id":"556240fa6368726ef7350200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Number1pegasus\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/556240c06368726c015f0200#post_556240c06368726c015f0200\r\nDon't look at me; I have 3 cram college classes and I'm already working on something.\r\n\r\n*edit\r\n. .
