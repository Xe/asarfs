The only time they really make any sense is when I'm aware I'm sleeping and as a result I make it into a X-rated dream.  I'm not even talking inception levels crazy, but like imagine a hoarder's house; that's basically what my dreams are where dvds/vcr tapes of movies I've seen, comics of things I've read, books and such are strewn about houses I've lived in and they're all stacked like a hoarder's house.
