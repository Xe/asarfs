Short version: medically speaking the dopamine high for virtual reality is so high that normal video gaming is like smoking cigarettes level addictive; virtual reality is just straight up crystal meth levels addictive.\r\n\r\n\r\nBasically the problem with vr is that the next generation of teens might get too addicted to it; I'm not talking throwing a fit if their parents take it away levels addicted, but just straight up can't function anymore without it levels addicted.\r\n\r\nThe reason why it might drastically effect society is because if you have a entire generation addicted to something to such a level that they can no longer function normally then of course that's going to change society.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"555e47296368726fdf580800","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Trying to get to drawing again\r\n\r\n!http://anony.ws/i/2015/05/21/doge001.jpg!","author":"5007bbdf7f123b112f00023a"},{"id":"555e473363687228ba881300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"","author":"37e5b9d66361642500af5e00"},{"id":"555e47566368723506e30000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@PaskaNaakka\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/555e47296368726fdf580800#post_555e47296368726fdf580800\r\nDude that's really good!
