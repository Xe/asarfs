Waiting for people to get on so I can play a game.\r\n\r\n2. It takes forever and I get really tired.\r\n\r\n3. Brain fucks up and becomes mentally unstable.\r\n\r\n4. Emotions.\r\n\r\n5. I start to get both really sad and angry at the same time about the fact that I couldn't accomplish my \"goal\" for the day before sleeping.\r\n\r\n6. Someone gets on and can play, I just pretty much give up and say that I'm too tired to play.\r\nPerson then adds that they'll be up for a while.\r\n\r\n7. I just answer with \"I'll wake up at like, 6 am...\".\r\n\r\n8. I miss out on opportunities to play with people and have fun. Always. Yay.\r\n\r\n9. ???\r\n\r\n10.
