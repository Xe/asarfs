Pretty sure all these idiots here have your back, and taking your concept of how reality is based on personal cognoscente rather than physical interaction, guess you could say they are literally there as you move on.[/bq]\r\nI don't mean to get sentimental, but if there is one thing most distinct about me is that I'm really fucking stubborn.  In this case if I wasn't so stubborn I would have just gave into depression and felt sorry for myself.  Years ago I could have just gave into how I used to be really insane and just felt sorry for myself.  I've had a really fucking rough life, but if you're as stubborn as me no matter how much shit gets flung in your face you get back up.  I've been through some shit, I've seen some shit and such but if life gives you lemons you flip the table and give them the middle finger and tell them to go fuck themselves with their damn lemons.\r\n\r\nI'm not just going to give up on transitioning just cause a couple unapologetic bastards think they know better than me just cause they watch foxnews; I probably won't be able to full time in six months like I wanted to, but a year from now isn't bad.\r\n\r\nTechnically speaking I overwhelmingly more than likely have severe depression, but how stubborn I am cancels it out.  Kind of funny; how much of a stubborn asshole I am cancels out my depression.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Me versus life:*\r\n!http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/701/966/194.gif!","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"557cd6f8636872754c000179","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/557cd6256368726894002148#post_557cd6256368726894002148\r\nIt's the first episode I watched.\r\n\"Tooth and Claw.\"","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"557cd72163687234b4000dc3","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Carcass Strife\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/557cd6f8636872754c000179#post_557cd6f8636872754c000179\r\nYou should watch \"Father's Day\".","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"557cd7cc63687234b4000ef3","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/557cd6256368726894002148#post_557cd6256368726894002148\r\nIf I've learned anything from my mom is that there's nothing wrong with being a bitch to anyone or anything that wants to cause you trouble. \r\n\r\nEspecially depression\r\n\r\nFuck depression","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"557cd7ef636872786100124f","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/557cd6256368726894002148#post_557cd6256368726894002148\r\n\r\nYou're pretty sentimental and illogical by your own self admission and hey, it will be a good day when you fund Aperture Science girl (Guess it's better to get used saying that?)","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"557cd836636872754c00039f","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I'm kind of wondering why exactly I love Komasan so much.","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"557cd8f0636872214b000880","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/557cd72163687234b4000dc3#post_557cd72163687234b4000dc3\r\nThis show has impressed me, so I will.
