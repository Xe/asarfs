Personally I dedicate all my efforts to rescuing the person as soon as possible and then use the days I have to spare to work on my social links. I have a feeling you can do both but I suck with scheduling. As for dialogue options I don't think there are any wrong choices or if there is I've never chose them. And you can boost interaction and your social links through other means. Whenever have the opportunity to make lunch, do it and invite someone to eat lunch with you. Some of your bros will call you on days off and ask if you want to hang out too.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"5586e92163687228fb0006d0","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Bananas","author":"5007bbdf7f123b112f00023a"},{"id":"5586eb966368726fc6000086","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5586e6616368724dce00194d#post_5586e6616368724dce00194d\r\n\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5586e7fa636872764c00088f#post_5586e7fa636872764c00088f\r\n\r\nThere are in fact wrong dialogue options. Most of the time its just manifests as not really helping you advance the social link and so you need to do more of the generic \"spend time with X?\" events that don't have any unique dialogue but do boost your s-links. However, there are a couple of choices that can outright break a s-link, but those are pretty obvious.\r\n\r\nAs for scheduling... I'd honestly recommend finding a guide on gamefaqs or something.","author":"4f41ee04945b701c41002af7"},{"id":"5586f76a63687279d80014a7","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5586e3286368724da70003cc#post_5586e3286368724da70003cc\r\ntim horton's for life; their coffee's fuckin incredible\r\n\r\nfuckin expensive too, but you get what you pay for","author":"50a843d47f123b2e7c001359"},{"id":"5586f8ba63687270140018d1","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@hype\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5586f76a63687279d80014a7#post_5586f76a63687279d80014a7\r\nTheir doughnuts are the best.\r\n\r\n\"Ferrari Horse in minutes...
