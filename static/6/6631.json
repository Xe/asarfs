See Michael Meyers, while evil in his own right, is still fallable. He still feels physical sensations. He can be hurt and even killed. Jason is unfeeling. Both emotionally amd physically.[/bq]\r\n\r\n>Michael Myers\r\n>He feels physical sensations\r\n>Can be killed\r\n>Implying Michael hasn't been shooted many times (one of them was a direct shoot in the head), being stabbed, survived a explosion, survived even after his head being smashed many times with a large pipe, crushed by a car, decapitated, hanged and even electrocuted.\r\n\r\nEven Jason can be \"killed\" and get hurt, but is unstoppable. Like Michael\r\nMichael _maybe_ can feel and even knows that is killing innocent people, but that doesn't mean he can be stopped.\r\nPeople even thinks that Michael is even more evil than Jason, judging by the fact that Jason is just a big and disturbing child.\r\n","author":"5239db6da4c72d22d9000358"},{"id":"5570d93063687254c3460100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Shadow the Hedgehog\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5570d7d563687273edd13500#post_5570d7d563687273edd13500\r\nJason's still a kid?","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"5570d99f6368721a13820400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Carcass Strife\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5570d93063687254c3460100#post_5570d93063687254c3460100\r\nNo, but mentally and psychologically he still a kid.","author":"5239db6da4c72d22d9000358"},{"id":"5570da1b63687254c33e0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Shadow the Hedgehog\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5570d99f6368721a13820400#post_5570d99f6368721a13820400\r\n^~Well, that's what you get for not going to school~^","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"5570dabe63687271fb922200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Carcass Strife\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5570da1b63687254c33e0200#post_5570da1b63687254c33e0200\r\n^And dying young in a lake^","author":"5239db6da4c72d22d9000358"},{"id":"5570db1f6368721a13860600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Shadow the Hedgehog\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5570dabe63687271fb922200#post_5570dabe63687271fb922200\r\n^~Damn children.~^","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"5570db906368721b773d1300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"Hitler is informed kitty0706 has passed away\":https://youtube.com/watch?v=QAIsESei3yY","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"5570df9563687254c3840800","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!https://i.imgur.com/SiC02.png!\r\n\r\nman i miss this type of quality moderation","author":"50a843d47f123b2e7c001359"},{"id":"5570e0036368721a13b80d00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://i1188.photobucket.com/albums/z408/majere616/GIFs/tumblr_lol0bmzOBd1qdx7pdo1_500.gif!","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"5570e0366368721b77711b00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5570e0036368721a13b80d00#post_5570e0036368721a13b80d00\r\nyay","author":"4ffbfff37f123b072a01bb5b"},{"id":"5570e0796368721a13720e00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5570e0036368721a13b80d00#post_5570e0036368721a13b80d00\r\nWB.","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"5570e20a63687254c3c90b00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Doraemon is quite good.
