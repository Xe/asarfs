We therefore do not permit the upload of:\r\n\r\n    Material that is intended to troll groups or individuals, and is of little or no artistic merit\r\n    Sexualized material involving characters that appear to be underaged and are not ponies (ie, humanizations)\r\n    Material which includes real-world human explicit material featuring individuals whose age cannot be verified\r\n    Attack material (images that attack or defame a group or individual)[/bq]  \r\n\r\nHowever:\r\n\r\n[bq]#n The rules are not complete or exhaustive\r\n\r\nThe rules define a spirit, and in some cases clarify particular points that we feel need clarification, but they are by no means an exhaustive list of everything you can't do.\r\n\r\nWe assume that our users are generally nice people who want this community and the site, as a resource, to be the best it can be.\r\n\r\nPeople who do not feel this way will inevitably cause trouble in new and interesting ways and when that impacts the site negatively, the administration team may choose to intervene to protect the site and users.[/bq]\r\n\r\nEven if explicit content is indeed forbidden among images uploaded and tag as anything but explicit. Posts among the forums therefore can be interpreted as following the same guidelines as images to certain extent.\r\n\r\nSpoilered explicit images have gotten leeway before but the circumstances behind them are left to the each individual mod criteria on how much they verge the line.","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"555ba3306368724fc9790800","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Ore-O\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/555ba298636872505e970500#post_555ba298636872505e970500\r\n!http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/947/826/4ae.jpg!","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"555ba3a86368724eb3b20900","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Meh","author":"37e5b9d66361642500af5e00"},{"id":"555ba3c4636872505ea00600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Ore-O\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/555ba298636872505e970500#post_555ba298636872505e970500\r\n!https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/c0/2b/30/c02b30a6c5b5cc98fcf9a8d1a7a0916d.jpg!","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"555ba47a6368726a8e651000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Meh","author":"37e5b9d66361642500af5e00"},{"id":"555ba4dc63687247b7b50c00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!https://derpicdn.net/img/view/2015/5/19/900098__safe_solo_twilight+sparkle_clothes_princess+twilight_equestria+girls_vector_dress_gala+dress_artist-colon-bubblestormx.png!
