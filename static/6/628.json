If you don't know how much it's shrinking conservatively by 2100 there's only going to be a billion Christians.  There's all sorts of projections on it, but a billion is the low bar estimate.  There's no real accurate long term estimate though because the current trends are highly unpredictable; the commonly accepted projections are 500 million to a billion.\r\n\r\nWhat is essentially happening right now is that the people going around claiming that the earth is only 6000 years old and that people lived with dinosaurs and that dinosaurs only ate veggies are the reason what's costing your religion the insane number of adherents it's losing.\r\n\r\nWhat I mean by this is to use a real life analogy back when I was a Christian the church I went to was one of these churches we're talking about.  It was a pretty average church growth and numbers wise, that's not important; what is interesting to note is the insane turnover rate.  What I mean by this is that for their middle school, high school and college classes every school year they would start out with next to no people then boom numbers wise then by the end of the year all those students would denounce the church cause the church taught lessons like we're talking about then they would start over all again and only about two or three people from the previous year would stick with it.\r\n\r\nThe reason why this is important is think about that math wise if a 300 person church gains 100 students over the school year and 98% of those students wind up dropping Christianity by the end of the school year then the cycle starts over again and endlessly repeats that's a lot of students that are denouncing Christianity all together cause their previous church taught \"dinosaurs lived with humans\" or such.  Now imagine hundreds of thousands of churches having this same system of working.  You can see why that's going to fuck things up for Christianity in general.\r\n\r\nThese sorts of churches save their own numbers by metaphorically suffocating everyone else.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53ab518563687243b4e90300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://www.guardianfox.net/wp-content/uploads/DSCF9086.JPG!\r\nTinfoil fedora.","author":"50b70eeb7f123b1a02000097"},{"id":"53ab5207636872432ea40300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53ab50a26368724294130300#post_53ab50a26368724294130300\r\nIt's too bad that there's a lot of nutters there\r\n\r\nChristianity is actually a very good religion if you really look at the big picture, It teaches you to love your fellow man unconditionally, And Stuff like that (And No, The new testament doesn't say anything about homosexuality)\r\n\r\n!http://oi62.tinypic.com/k9uczp.jpg!\r\nYou thought it was Trashboat?
