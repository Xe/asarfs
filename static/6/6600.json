Well fuck I hate being right sometimes.  Basically my theory that younger generations while supporting things like gay marriage, pot or such they will in the long run become conservative in other things and as a result what is \"conservative\" vs \"progressive\" is going to change was right.\r\n\r\nBasically there's a drug on market to stop the spread of HIV and the sad thing is that people just aren't buying it unless they know the person does have HIV and even then a low rate buy it.  We have medicine to stop the spread of HIV and people aren't taking it and even though medicine to stop the spread of stds are being developed people aren't taking them even when they know the person is infected.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat do I mean by this?\r\n20 years from now 40+ year olds, \"Say no to STD prevention medicine!  It's unnatural!\" and that age group being riddled with stds whereas younger generations stds are unheard of in their demographic.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"556e719f63687252b9393900","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Attack on Titan have 3 OVAS...","author":"5239db6da4c72d22d9000358"},{"id":"556e720263687252b90f3a00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Shadow the Hedgehog\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/556e70f763687221d9631300#post_556e70f763687221d9631300\r\nGrashful","author":"4fdef063945b700a9d01604f"},{"id":"556e7218636872395d050200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/16/115597.jpg!\r\nGay samurai cat.","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"556e726063687268c9f70000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/556e7218636872395d050200#post_556e7218636872395d050200\r\nIs Nyanpire on KissAnime?\r\nBecause you're making a really compelling case.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"556e727163687273d80a2300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/556e726063687268c9f70000#post_556e726063687268c9f70000\r\nyes it is","author":"4ffbfff37f123b072a01bb5b"},{"id":"556e727a63687230a24f1b00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/556e7218636872395d050200#post_556e7218636872395d050200\r\nWait he's Gay?
