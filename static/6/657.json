Fifty years from now chances are there's no one going to be left in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria or so forth cause everyone will have left ages ago.\r\n\r\nRight now many of them simply don't have the means to leave, but that sure as hell won't stop people from trying and eventually people are going to go \"fuck it\" and either take just what they can carry and walk on foot.\r\n\r\nThat's probably going to be a huge problem in a couple decades everyone globally having to figure out where the hell to put everyone.  Europe already is having problems with immigration, but imagine how bad it's going to be when the entire middle east area finally says \"fuck it\" and all just leave.\r\n\r\n\r\nHonestly such a potential situation is utterly shitty, but it sure as hell would solve a lot of wars.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53aeb167636872690cbc0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"For fellow Game Grumps fans, especially the ones that were around when Jon and Arin were together; I give you this heart warming master piece\":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaMBPw7N4YQ","author":"50c204917f123b31440000a5"},{"id":"53af2f43636872701bb50000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"colombia - 2\r\nuruguay - 0\r\n\r\ni dont like football too much but its good we do something good.","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"53af32a16368727329b50100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!https://31.media.tumblr.com/e49f17571a6807be52c2ea41335ccc75/tumblr_mrc93vnI951qkj77do5_1280.png!\r\n!https://31.media.tumblr.com/4a8906a935aa11314b71d8db720d366e/tumblr_mrc93vnI951qkj77do4_1280.png!\r\n!https://31.media.tumblr.com/4d0bb7bb29dff69ede52bfbd0e5c6572/tumblr_mrc93vnI951qkj77do6_1280.png!\r\n!https://38.media.tumblr.com/405dfcbac11768870304dd5b59c93b2e/tumblr_mrc93vnI951qkj77do7_1280.png!  \r\n!https://31.media.tumblr.com/1b01dddc0ead0cc47212c252ccd1d16a/tumblr_mrc93vnI951qkj77do1_1280.png! \r\n!https://31.media.tumblr.com/88da9beea72c7e836e3f111b129e005b/tumblr_mrc93vnI951qkj77do9_1280.png! \r\n\r\n","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"53af395a636872701b5e0400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"Galaxy found 6,000 light years from Earth\":http://www.satirewire.com/content1/?p=5878 \r\n\r\n(Satire)","author":"50b70eeb7f123b1a02000097"},{"id":"53af3a5963687271fe640400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"W-B-X Hard boiled Extreme\":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ncu4W0GmFs0","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"53af3c266368726f727d0500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"So I was going over the latest information about whether or not oculus will succeed and it opened my eyes on a few things.\r\n\r\nTo make it short and sweet you know how everyone seems to fit into two categories of \"It's going to be the biggest thing ever\" or \"It's going to be the biggest flop ever\"?  You're both right actually.\r\n\r\nWhat I mean by this is every company has jumped the gun and jumped onto the bandwagon too early investing too much money into developing it.  What I mean by this is let's look at smart phones.  For years there was extreme hype over the technology and saying <insert company here> would completely take over the market; fast forward to 2014 and the hype over smart phones has for the most part subsided with everyone realizing they jumped the gun into a technology that didn't actually give them a leg up on the competition because everyone sells smart phones and smart phones accessories.\r\n\r\nWhat does this mean for oculus?  Basically it's going to financially fail big time not cause of anything facebook does to it or any bad decisions, rather too much competition will come about.\r\n\r\nTo summarize what I'm getting at is what the most probable outcome of VR is it's going to be the newest gaming craze for a couple years then the enthusiasm for it will die out.  Five years from now every console and computer will come with their own $25-$50 version and that will be the end of the hype.  To use a analogy when the computer mouse first came out there was extreme financial hype around it saying that it was going to give <insert company here> complete control over the computer market, but now no one thinks anything of it.\r\n\r\nTl:dr; VR is a short term hype train(I'm guessing 5 year long hype train) that will end with it no longer being considered a big deal in much the same way that computer mouses are no longer considered a big deal even though every computer comes with a mouse.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53af3f226368726197410000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I had a dream last night about a person murdering two teenagers by throwing them into a lake with a bull shark in it.","author":"50b70eeb7f123b1a02000097"},{"id":"53af42956368726127070100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://i522.photobucket.com/albums/w341/DragonboyGT/ZakuvsTanks_zpsc1361479.gif?t=1403994572!","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"53af4430636872641b510100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"What would you do with telekinesis powers?\r\n\r\nI would do Indian burns on people's dicks.","author":"50b70eeb7f123b1a02000097"},{"id":"53af5b5b6368720741b30200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@twistedmetalero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53af32a16368727329b50100#post_53af32a16368727329b50100\r\n[bq=\"twistedmetalero\"]!https://31.media.tumblr.com/e49f17571a6807be52c2ea41335ccc75/tumblr_mrc93vnI951qkj77do5_1280.png!\r\n!https://31.media.tumblr.com/4a8906a935aa11314b71d8db720d366e/tumblr_mrc93vnI951qkj77do4_1280.png!\r\n!https://31.media.tumblr.com/4d0bb7bb29dff69ede52bfbd0e5c6572/tumblr_mrc93vnI951qkj77do6_1280.png!\r\n!https://38.media.tumblr.com/405dfcbac11768870304dd5b59c93b2e/tumblr_mrc93vnI951qkj77do7_1280.png!  \r\n!https://31.media.tumblr.com/1b01dddc0ead0cc47212c252ccd1d16a/tumblr_mrc93vnI951qkj77do1_1280.png! \r\n!https://31.media.tumblr.com/88da9beea72c7e836e3f111b129e005b/tumblr_mrc93vnI951qkj77do9_1280.png! \r\n\r\n[/bq]\r\nTHAT SHOW.","author":"50884a9b7f123b4053000d18"},{"id":"53af62ac6368720741a40500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://i522.photobucket.com/albums/w341/DragonboyGT/lolwut_zpsa00c47fc.jpg!\r\nLolwut?","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"53af62dc6368720761510500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53af62ac6368720741a40500#post_53af62ac6368720741a40500\r\nOh jesus Christ why?","author":"50c204917f123b31440000a5"},{"id":"53af62e7636872068ce40400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"*'Sup nerds!?*","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"53af63126368720761720500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53af62e7636872068ce40400#post_53af62e7636872068ce40400\r\nSup, did you check on the island?","author":"513e68eda4c72d4e3b000164"},{"id":"53af6369636872066aac0500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Ore-O\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53af63126368720761720500#post_53af63126368720761720500\r\nYeah.
