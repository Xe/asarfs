Looking a bit into smart phones it looks like smart phones will play a important part in the future, but not in the way people think; short version is that phone gaming is profitable but it's really bad and doesn't return a lot of money.  What smart phones do well is basic stuff like browse the internet, watch youtube, etc.  Essentially what smart phones may be in ten years is a portable computer for doing work, conferences, youtube, email, etc, but they won't be for gaming.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe supreme court is to decide on gay marriage in less than five weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe NSA spying dragnet spying might not come back.  They were expecting a backup bill to be in the senate already, but it's starting to grind down.  Essentially what is happening right now is that politically enough people oppose the nsa spying that repassing the patriot act is nearly impossible; if they want to bring back the patriot act it probably will take months and months of revisions to it and essentially gutting the majority of it to get it to pass.  The longer this shit drags on the harder it will be to bring back the dragnet spying and the more narrow and narrow their spying will become.\r\n\r\n\r\n3D printed car.  3D printed rocket engine for SpaceX (the world's first private commercial space rocket company).  3D printed house only costs $5k; imagine buying a 3000 square foot house for $5k?\r\n\r\n\r\nSecondlife's creators are working on a new project called \"metaverse\" which is drastically different from secondlife and more like individual servers.  Basically imagine secondlife x garry's mod x imvu where the items are sold externally or through a UI rather than having all that constant advertising crap in game.  The idea is rather than a simulated landscape all connected instead it's more of individuals servers that you log onto.  Eh; I'm on the fence cause on the downside it's essentially going to be secondlife 2.0, but on the other hand A)less advertising crap cause everything would be sold externally thus reducing the objects you need to load thus reducing lag and/or items needed to load B)individual servers instead of that stupid \"interconnected world\" crap etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nDriverless 18 wheelers are in Nevada.\r\n\r\n\r\nNASA is looking at using freaking laser beams to de-orbit space junk.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince 1985 there's been a trillion fold increase in computation of computers; this is drastically more than what moore's law predicted.\r\n\r\n\r\nCable may be dying.  Right now companies are looking at turning to internet tv instead.  Essentially in say ten years if you want tv instead of a cable you'll have a box that you hook up to your router to watch tv instead. . . I don't even need to start to explain why I wouldn't buy this.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"556e0e306368724bb8a60500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Gæaãāąhh\r\n\r\ncan't sleep\r\n\r\n!http://ell.akamai.coub.com/get/bucket:22.31/p/coub/simple/cw_gif_big/01be51ebf4b/1c919ea45bfa8b7ba60f3/1409455366_1386239994_1mxbwod_z7vik0y.gif!","author":"5007bbdf7f123b112f00023a"},{"id":"556e1064636872735a400c00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/556e08e963687258673a0800#post_556e08e963687258673a0800\r\nNASA apparently thinks diversity is more important than space travel.

NASA just hires people according to their qualification.  Everyone knows Hillary is going to win the election so posing pretty for the camera and being a huge kiss ass is a good way to get the needed funding.  It's like how whenever someone's incredibly rich everyone they know are fake nice to them cause they want money.  Everyone knows Hillary is going to be the next president so all the governmental organizations are being huge kiss asses to the democrats so that they bug her for extra funding *when* she becomes president.\r\n\r\nSecondly the way the laser thing works is that by heating one side of the space junk that can change it's directory so if you super heat the side away from the earth that will destabilize it's orbit eventually causing it to crash into the earth.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"556e15006368723119880300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/556e135c636872628e160400#post_556e135c636872628e160400\r\nah good. \r\n\r\nBut I will say, Diversity is a slippery slope as we have seen.
