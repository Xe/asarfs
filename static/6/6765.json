I get the feeling Disney is a tad bit of a sore loser. In Marvel comics, the Fantastic four comic has been canceled and the x memn and mutant kind have been pushed off into space.

Mmmmm hmmm.\r\n\r\nBy the way did I mention Fantastic Four and X men's films rights are owned by 20th century fox. And merchandize for xmen and fantastic four just happened to stop being made.

Essentially if you make too many movies of the same genre in a short time frame the general populace gets tired of it.  It's just my personal opinion but I think Disney is essentially trying to squeeze out every last drop of hype AND money as they possibly can before people wind up getting sick of superheroes.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5577cce763687241d4000de3","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5577cb716368726ef000114f#post_5577cb716368726ef000114f\r\nHonestly. The universe after Secret wars  and Secret Wars itself sounds cool.\r\n\r\nDr doom has actually won, he's God. Sure hell be beaten\r\n\r\nThe tie ins sound cool: planet hulk, a captain America and devil dinosaur vs a bunch of hulks. A bunch of ghost riders racing for their souls. Cowboy marvel. Spider man vows renewed. an ultron army vs a marvel zombies universe.\r\n\r\nAlso There's gonna be three spider mans in the new universe; spiderman, spider Gwen, miles morales. And Kamala khan is still around. Yay!\r\n\r\nThe fact that Disney seems to be a sore loser is a sour note though.","author":"500757fd7f123b75a90003b1"},{"id":"5577cdac63687273b50007a5","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5577cc7a6368720e6600005e#post_5577cc7a6368720e6600005e\r\nIts not really Disney so much as them, DC, and...everyone else.\r\n\r\nI love superheros, but I'm staring to think \" guys!
