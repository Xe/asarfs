Wolf Children, Summer Wars, and Our War Game. And I think I've realized something. Hosoda is a MASTER of the cry. When characters in Hosoda's films cry it's never a delicate quiet \"single tear on the cheek\" kind of nonsense. It's always loud, humiliating and kind of uncomfortable to watch. And I think that's the point. These characters arent attractive when they cry because sadness isn't attractive.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"}]}
