Short version: you know how she keeps claiming to not be Jack Thompson 2.0?  Well she's gone fullblown 100% Jack Thompson to the point AAA studios are coming out against them.\r\n\r\nIt's hilarious cause what is essentially happening:\r\nAnita, \"I'm not Jack Thompson!\"\r\nDevs, \"Here's our support\"\r\nAnita, \"All violence in games should be banned!\"\r\nAAA companies, \"Fuck that!\"\r\n\r\nThe reason why I'm laughing my ass off is that feminists have realized they've been worshiping the Jack Thompson 2.0 and they're trying to run away from the monster they've created as fast as possible by trying to rebrand themselves as fast as possible but the weight of the monster they've created is impossible to escape.\r\n\r\n\r\nTl:dr of current drama shit going on in the internet; Jack Thompson 2.0 comes out of the metaphorical closet and admits she's just trying to get rid of violence in games -> her supporters are going \"OH SHIT!  We've created Jack Thompson 2.0! RUN! QUICK CHANGE OUR NAME!  DO SOMETHING!  ANYTHING!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm laughing cause it's legitimately hilarious, it's not even the cringe kind of hilarity either.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5581f6996368722b69002eb1","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5581f631636872110900528e#post_5581f631636872110900528e\r\nI guess this is the beginning of the downfall of the menace.","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"5581f6af6368721323003684","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5581f631636872110900528e#post_5581f631636872110900528e\r\nI'm curious, how tame of violence have they gone after?\r\n\r\nLike is Mario too violent, what's their limit?","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"5581f7be6368723c8e001924","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5581f6af6368721323003684#post_5581f6af6368721323003684\r\nwell I do seem to remember a certain \"transformative media maker\" going after the avengers movies for their violence.
