I think they're realizing that they're almost out of steam and are throwing crying tantrums.\r\n\r\nWe're legitimately less than one month away from the supreme court *HAVING* to rule on gay marriage and the odds are in pro-glbt's favor.\r\n\r\n\r\nConservative estimate wise we're looking at around the 43-45 states legalized mark and a fair chance of somewhere in the 46-48 mark; I hope it will be completely legalized but I'm not holding my breath.  Even if they side with the anti-glbt side it's pretty much game over already cause a lot of courts have already ruled in favor of gay marriage.  Worst case scenario the last seven states go kicking and screaming over the next judicial calender cause the lower courts know they have to rule on it and they know that they don't have any legal arguments to keep it banned.\r\n\r\nTl:dr; chances are gay marriage will be legalized in several states in a month and the last stragglers will go kicking and screaming in the following months.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"556e6a976368726a2f211800","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@QuasarNova\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/556e6a2863687252b9632700#post_556e6a2863687252b9632700\r\nHaving sex with Arceus can bring some benefits?","author":"5239db6da4c72d22d9000358"},{"id":"556e6aa563687221d9670a00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/556e68ba63687222521b0e00#post_556e68ba63687222521b0e00\r\n\"@Number1pegasus\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/556e68ff63687272b65d1b00#post_556e68ff63687272b65d1b00\r\nI still haven't seen any of SU\r\nTv repels me and I have no idea why \r\n\r\n\r\n\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/556e692763687230a2bf0c00#post_556e692763687230a2bf0c00\r\nThat would probably be unwise with a magcargo","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"556e6aea63687272b6152000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/556e6aa563687221d9670a00#post_556e6aa563687221d9670a00\r\nDon't tell me.\r\n\r\n_Lazyness?_","author":"5239db6da4c72d22d9000358"},{"id":"556e6af36368720258a91d00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Shadow the Hedgehog\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/556e6a976368726a2f211800#post_556e6a976368726a2f211800\r\n\r\nIsn't he supposed to be gigantic?
