If you have your flashlight on at night goodbye; if you're rapidly running around goodbye.  You legitimately have to think about it tactically cause the enemies don't have a alert cooldown; they don't have the attention span of a fish; unless you silent kill a enemy they're going to notice; if you leave a body out in the middle of the road they're going to notice.\r\n\r\n!https://31.media.tumblr.com/8a27ed556cbb728b3a9f3f340ab8e72e/tumblr_inline_n2293u4tLj1qdvqd9.gif!","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"55630044636872290a543c00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5562ffb36368723e395b2500#post_5562ffb36368723e395b2500\r\nIt's like real life except it's not.

The biggest problem with it gameplay wise though is that you can't fix your guns so think about what gun has the most common/cheapest ammo that is pretty decent and have a backup badass gun for when you really need it and try to keep light.\r\n\r\nClear Sky has a repair mechanism, a faction mechanism and a upgrade mechanism.  You can upgrade your guns with stuff real life parts on real life guns; they won't make the gun shoot faster or such, but drastically reduce recoil.\r\n\r\nCall of Pripyat is gameplay wise the best out of the three, but it's also the shortest cause the studio was getting fucked over budget wise.  Call of Pripyat is about half the gameplay hours as the other games.  I would not suggest getting this alone cause of how short it is.\r\n\r\nI would buy the package deal on steam cause all three games are only $40","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"55630470636872290a094600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"My dad keeps using me as a human safe to store cash.\r\nAnd I have to be responsible over it.\r\n\r\n^~WHY CAN'T YOU JUST PUT IT IN A BANK~^","author":"4fe1b9f47f123b13df002976"},{"id":"556305e463687268dce01700","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@HJSDGCE\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55630470636872290a094600#post_55630470636872290a094600\r\nIt's actually smarter to put it into a bank because they have small growth percentages.
