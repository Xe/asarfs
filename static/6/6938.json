So far the only thing to go off truthfully is that its what Miyamoto said a \"Reimagining\".\r\n\r\nLike basically a Reimagining of the first game almost. So with that I'm trying to figure out if that indeed means Reboot or not. \r\n\r\nSo far a lot of people are saying No, and a lot of people are saying Yes. \r\n\r\nSo the only thing to go off of is really just what Miyamoto said. And until the game is released and people ask more about the game.
