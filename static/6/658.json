Essentially what I've thought about is make a video game, but make it borderline open source.  The problem with having something completely open source is that for one you can't make money and two it falls to shit when one guy joins and does something wrong.\r\n\r\nIn short my idea is make a 20-30 minute game with all the bells and whistles and all the programming is done then make it to where if you wanted to use the game to make your own game to make money you could, just need a licensing fee.  You know how call of duty every video game they essentially make the same game?  Well do that to where other companies can go, \"Hey for only a licensing fee we can have this completely complete game and build off top of it\".\r\n\r\nTl:dr; My idea is to make essentially a garry's mod for professionals.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53af79b36368721f7b250600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"glory to arstotzka","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"53af87cc6368724755240000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"If uc9 was president, he would likely be recognized as one of the greatest presidents ever.","author":"50b70eeb7f123b1a02000097"},{"id":"53af893c63687278f2010000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Randomosaur\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53af87cc6368724755240000#post_53af87cc6368724755240000\r\nProbably; I would run it as a technocracy or a government in which hiring people to government positions due to their family connections/business connections is illegal and that any and all government positions are fulfilled solely on the person's authority in the field.
