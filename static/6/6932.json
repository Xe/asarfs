If people have the ability to have that level of sexual stimulation without needing another person then chances are that will push a lot of assholes of society out of the reproductive pool cause people will have the ability for sexual stimulation without people and thus will only choose to date when they want to date.\r\n\r\nTo put it better:\r\nIn say ten years I think the percentage of usa citizens that are single will be incredibly high, but it's because they will be waiting to choose someone they like instead of marrying out of wedlock and as a result while the percentage of people in relationships will be down the marriages will last ten times longer than the current average cause people will only marry people they like.\r\n\r\nTl:dr; purely guessing, but I think the reason why people don't want new technologies is because the norm will be people marrying only people they legitimately love instead out of wedlock.  Like the anti-condom argument; they don't want condoms cause they want people to be forced to marry out of wedlock.[/bq]\r\nWill people still be allowed to marry people the old fashion way?
