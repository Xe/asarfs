Same with cartoons and such.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat caused the almost death of cartoon characters or good games during what I like to call the era of shit?  Easy: cgi, live action disney shows, companies removing any sort of creativity in gaming just to compete cause costs were high.\r\n\r\nEvery new character in a game costs money; so if you have characters without a skeletal structure that costs more money.  The cheap thing to do is to do the call of duty thing, make all the enemies into humans, give them armor and rather than most of them talking just have a mask on their face.\r\n\r\nWhat do I think is changing?  The costs of publishing and putting things out is going down.\r\n\r\n1)Cable companies are looking at having internet tv.  Essentially traditional cable television would be dead.\r\n2)If traditional cable is dead then you can have a million channels and still make a profit; you would just pay say $1/month for disney, $1/month for cnn and pay for the individual channels.\r\n3)Digital distribution of games is much more profitable.  Sorry console fans, but the cost of distributing hard copies of games is extremely expensive.  That's why pc is winning the console race cause all the little/medium guys don't have the money for physical distribution cause physical distribution costs hundreds of thousands of dollars so they make the games pc only so consoles have less and less non-AAA games; to use an analogy besides the screen controller driving up prices on the wiiu by a hundred dollars the lack of third party games killed it.\r\n4)Ten years ago freemium game engines were crap; nowadays they're pretty decent.  Obviously you can't make a AAA mountain dew doritos 11/10 GOTY -ign game on say Unity but you can make pretty decent games.\r\n5)AAA gaming is shrinking.  To much of a financial risk; they're being replaced by mid range games.  Mid range games are good cause they're not too big too fail and they're not driven by hipsters on a political agenda like the indie scene.\r\n6)FPS games are shrinking and nobody is to fill the gap.  Sure League of Legends is ungodly popular but nobody can directly compete with them so no crappy clones.\r\n7)Digital distribution is getting cheaper and cheaper cause ten years ago a company making say a 10gb file available to millions of people was extremely expensive, now a lot of people can do it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTl:dr; costs of making games are getting cheaper every year so chances are we're going to see another golden age of gaming in a couple years cause companies will be able to be creative again without having to worry too much about financial risks.\r\n\r\nTl:dr of Tl:dr; lower costs of digital distribution = more profit.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"556fe8f96368723347510e00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/556fe858636872357b340100#post_556fe858636872357b340100\r\nOh!
