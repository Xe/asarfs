The thing is though that in the dream cause shit hit the fan so hard at a military complex the android part was stuck in permanent defense mode; I was still me and all that, but the second anybody tried to take something off to examine it would trigger a defensive reaction cause when it happened the android part registered a massive terrorist attack so it constantly thought there was a terrorist attack underhand 24/7, but cause it was me cause personality wise I would never kill someone ever under any circumstance I would black out and wake up with the mechanic having his arms and legs broken twenty different ways but nothing severe at all.  What was eventually devised was sort of a medical coma in which I would relive the events leading up to that so that I would dream the information so they could salvage the project while it working as a sort of mental therapy at the same time.\r\n\r\n\r\nSide note: yes I have strange dreams.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"55814ace63687242dd0005c5","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55814a3063687214c60024b2#post_55814a3063687214c60024b2\r\nThat's one interesting dream.","author":"4fdef063945b700a9d01604f"},{"id":"55814bff6368723d4900017f","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55814a3063687214c60024b2#post_55814a3063687214c60024b2\r\nWhy does everybody else get the best dreams, and not me :C","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"55814c1f63687214c60028a7","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"This is strange.
