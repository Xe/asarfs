At the rate that bacteria are becoming immune to treatment it very well could become a serious problem in the future for impoverished countries.\r\n\r\nObviously I'm not talking a *click* third world countries gone, rather say the number of deaths due to MRSA won't go down.  In say fifty years there won't be countries like Syria anymore cause they'll be so riddled with constant disease outbreaks that eventually they'll collapse.\r\n\r\nObviously first and second world countries won't be effected, but like north korea, syria, iraq, libya and countries that have had long term poverty will in the long run collapse cause their death rate will outstrip their birth rate.\r\n\r\n\r\n2050:\r\n\"Welcome to CNN; the airborne, waterborne, bloodborne epidemic variation of MRSA now dubbed 'Ragnorak' yesterday alone killed a estimated 10,000 people in north korea, libya and other impoverished countries; meanwhile only two cases were reported in all of europe or the usa yesterday where they received immediate medical attention and within two hours were given a clean bill of health.  'Ragnorak''s unstoppable rampage through impoverished countries has left a estimated one and a half billion people dead over the course of the last ten years.  Just last week the remaining population of Syria were to have been reported as no longer with us; Syria was officially de-listed as a country as in order to be a country there must inhabitants.  The only thing slowing down 'Ragnorak''s rampage throughout the world is that simply put: there are very few impoverished regions left untouched.\"\r\n\r\nThat's why people get so scared over diseases cause obviously that sort of shit won't seriously effect developed countries, but if we're talking about a disease that is immune to everything and kills slower than it infects. . that's going to be a problem. . that's why people are shitting themselves about stuff like MRSA.\r\n\r\nHow there's diseases now immune to practically everything you can possibly throw at it does legitimately scare me, cause it's a pandemic waiting to happen.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"55717dd36368724134103400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Hey, guys.
