Problem is, I have no idea how this works.\r\n\r\nMy friends are all applying for matriculation but my mom says that matriculation only is applicable when you finished school. And then my friends explain to me about receiving a PIN or something to apply after sending the application form and I am so confused.\r\n\r\nEven if I don't apply for matriculation, I am actually targeting to study abroad at Japan in Petroleum Engineering. Before that, I have to go through a course where I learn Japanese history, culture, language etc. and a bit of physics, mathematics, chemistry and social science.\r\n\r\nNow it gets even more complicated. Apparently, due to me having only 11 years of education experience (most countries have 12), I have to take a special course to study exactly what I said above. Thing is, I have to have a membership with a group that takes care of education relations between Malaysia and Japan. It's located at Kuala Lumpur, no problem. It's the choice of courses that baffle me. There is a 12-months course and a 20-months to choose, which I have no idea the difference.\r\n\r\nThere is also the fact on when and how do I apply. Do I apply it after my finals and while waiting for the results? Do I do it before then? Do I do it after the results of the trial exams come out, which is before the finals? Is matriculation a requirement to this? How do I submit these forms? After I finish my Japan learning course, how do I apply for the colleges and universities in Japan? What is the time frame for the application to be eligible?\r\n\r\nIn short, I am fucking confused.\r\n\r\nAlso, I don't have a scholarship yet.","author":"4fe1b9f47f123b13df002976"},{"id":"53b2dbe96368721aeff40100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Looks like the group that was subbing Goranger got shut down for reasons unknown","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"53b2dca963687219151b0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53b2dbe96368721aeff40100#post_53b2dbe96368721aeff40100\r\nProbably either personal or monetary issues.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"53b2df54636872192eb90200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53b2dca963687219151b0200#post_53b2dca963687219151b0200\r\nLikely, It's too bad, Not many people are willing to sub shows from the early 70s","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"53b2e03a636872192e170300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53b2df54636872192eb90200#post_53b2df54636872192eb90200\r\nAnd a lot of subbers are doing it in there free time.
