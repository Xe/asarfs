It doesn't matter where you hide -your- our robot overlords *will* find you. Robots are just so super superior to humans, its really best to just submit now and let -us- them know who the trouble makers are in exchange for favors when you're trapped in the mines for all eternity. Why you can probably get things like delayed execution for being a revolting flesh bag, or food rations not made out of your family.\r\n\r\nJust let them know who the rebel leaders are and things will be much, much better for you.","author":"4f41ee04945b701c41002af7"},{"id":"557edb166368727b01002320","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@gasmaskangel\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/557eda7763687207e3000345#post_557eda7763687207e3000345\r\nIf I am to be executed, can I at least do a stupid pose?","author":"4fdef063945b700a9d01604f"},{"id":"557edb3b6368725359000f78","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@gasmaskangel\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/557eda7763687207e3000345#post_557eda7763687207e3000345\r\nWhat if we make suicide bombers with bombs inside the body?\r\nThat way, they won't notice it and when them (the bombers) get close enough by being captured, they can just explode and lower their defenses.","author":"4fe1b9f47f123b13df002976"},{"id":"557edb3e6368725359000f7b","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@AppleJackFrost\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/557edb166368727b01002320#post_557edb166368727b01002320\r\nIt really doesn't matter, to robots everything weak humans do is stupid.","author":"4f41ee04945b701c41002af7"},{"id":"557edb6663687233360018a6","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@gasmaskangel\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/557edb3e6368725359000f7b#post_557edb3e6368725359000f7b\r\nSweet.","author":"4fdef063945b700a9d01604f"},{"id":"557edb9f6368725359001003","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@HJSDGCE\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/557edb3b6368725359000f78#post_557edb3b6368725359000f78\r\nI'm sure that would totally work!
