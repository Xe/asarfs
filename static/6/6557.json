He did it right off the roof of our garage. My parents protected me enough that I only realized that he was gone. I used to have this horse swing that my dad made for me. The rope on it was old and really smooth on my hands from it being used so much. I have a distinct memory of the rope being replaced with a new one and I hated it so much because it was rough on my hands. I probably even complained to my parents about it. It wasn't until years later when I found out that my brother had cut down my favorite swing to use the rope to commit suicide. I still feel awful about my anger as a child about it. It's irrational, but I can't let go of it._","author":"37e5b9d66361642500af5e00"},{"id":"556c46d563687272f6566100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Kaz\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/556c467f63687272f62d6000#post_556c467f63687272f62d6000\r\nDid your personal brother commit suicide or is this copied from elsewhere?","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"556c477c6368723847c13100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/556c46d563687272f6566100#post_556c46d563687272f6566100\r\n[bq=\"uc9\"]\"@Kaz\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/556c467f63687272f62d6000#post_556c467f63687272f62d6000\r\nDid your personal brother commit suicide or is this copied from elsewhere?[/bq]\r\nCopied but i found it depressing","author":"37e5b9d66361642500af5e00"},{"id":"556c4c326368723437181e00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"You are become to zombie\r\n\r\nWhat do","author":"5007bbdf7f123b112f00023a"},{"id":"556c4d0963687245bc800400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/556c3d4063687272f6084200#post_556c3d4063687272f6084200\r\ni prefer my new avi to Yaiba because it matches my overall mood very well","author":"4ffbfff37f123b072a01bb5b"},{"id":"556c4d0f63687245bc830400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@PaskaNaakka\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/556c4c326368723437181e00#post_556c4c326368723437181e00\r\nSpeaking of zombies, did you watch that Norwegian film 'Dead Snow' and it's sequel?\r\n\r\nThe Russian zombie boss was rad.","author":"52f0834d63687261cba90300"},{"id":"556c4d266368723437072000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Albus Fahrenheits\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/556c4d0f63687245bc830400#post_556c4d0f63687245bc830400\r\nHaven't had the pleasure","author":"5007bbdf7f123b112f00023a"},{"id":"556c4dac6368723437ea2000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@PaskaNaakka\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/556c4d266368723437072000#post_556c4d266368723437072000\r\nYou'll love it, broseph.\r\n\r\nJust think of any Nazi Zombie film and turn into comedy.\r\nThe second film adds Commie Zombies who are with the good guys.","author":"52f0834d63687261cba90300"},{"id":"556c4db8636872602c040300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@PaskaNaakka\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/556c4c326368723437181e00#post_556c4c326368723437181e00\r\nFind brain\r\nEat brain\r\n","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"556c4f0b63687245bcc10600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/556c4db8636872602c040300#post_556c4db8636872602c040300\r\n[bq=\"Too_Offensive\"]\"@PaskaNaakka\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/556c4c326368723437181e00#post_556c4c326368723437181e00\r\nFind brain\r\nEat brain\r\n[/bq]\r\n*Puts you at tumblr's head quarters*\r\n*Waits for you to starve to death*","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"556c4fca6368726fa9cd0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/556c4f0b63687245bcc10600#post_556c4f0b63687245bcc10600\r\nThat's evil","author":"4fdef063945b700a9d01604f"},{"id":"556c50576368727477c10000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"One more thing about zombies.\r\n\r\nWhich is best?\r\nvirus or voodoo","author":"52f0834d63687261cba90300"},{"id":"556c510963687261f5280600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Albus Fahrenheits\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/556c4d0f63687245bc830400#post_556c4d0f63687245bc830400\r\nI watched that.\r\nLoved that wheelchair zombie.","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"556c51206368720c59020100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I'm reminded of my friend with all this zombie talk.","author":"4fdef063945b700a9d01604f"},{"id":"556c523163687261f5330a00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Albus Fahrenheits\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/556c50576368727477c10000#post_556c50576368727477c10000\r\n[bq=\"Albus Fahrenheits\"]One more thing about zombies.\r\n\r\nWhich is best?\r\nvirus or voodoo[/bq]\r\nYou guys do realize there's actual voodoo zombies right?\r\n\r\nWell not really undead, but basically real life \"zombies\" are people that get drugged, fed a poison and used as slave labor.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"556c52e16368727be1a40500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Carcass Strife\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/556c510963687261f5280600#post_556c510963687261f5280600\r\nWheelchair zombie was awesome.
