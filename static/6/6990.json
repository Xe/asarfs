Like how the romans were effected by the greeks and roman culture bleed through to other countries.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf gay marriage is legalized in the usa then chances are other countries are going to start legalizing it one after the other.\r\n\r\nMy guess is that asia is next on the list; asia is anti-glbt, but primarily because of tradition.  Fighting against tradition is way easier than fighting against religious belief.  IE how japan legalized civil unions, the difference is in this case under legal law in japan civil unions are effectively the same thing unlike how in the usa it was a bastardized version.  What I mean by all this is that what is probably going to happen is that over the next twenty years the overwhelming majority of civilized countries will legalize gay marriage, china will probably legalize it, india will probably, etc, etc until the only wide scale regions left are in the middle east and africa.  Sure say individual countries here and there like north korea will still be illegal, but you get what I'm saying.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5587605663687251ce000ea6","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Again, I think to myself, why don't have a stylish outfit like a fighting game character","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"5587605763687278b00030d3","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Fuck it.\r\nI'm watching Jungle Fury.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"558760af6368720e58003eed","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55875fbf6368723a030007f2#post_55875fbf6368723a030007f2\r\n[bq=\"SquiggyBomb\"]\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55875f776368723a03000788#post_55875f776368723a03000788\r\nMy stylish accessory is my fabulous plumber moustache.[/bq]\r\n","author":"5239db6da4c72d22d9000358"},{"id":"558760c0636872416c001770","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5587605763687278b00030d3#post_5587605763687278b00030d3\r\nJungle Fury was awesome.","author":"52f0834d63687261cba90300"},{"id":"558760e5636872416c0017bc","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Albus Fahrenheits\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/558760c0636872416c001770#post_558760c0636872416c001770\r\nIt was like a cheesy kung-fu movie but with Power Rangers!","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"5587610c63687208da000037","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5587605663687251ce000ea6#post_5587605663687251ce000ea6\r\nI want one too\r\nBut they usually end up looking pretty dumb in reality.
