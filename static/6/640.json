This time over something incredibly fucking stupid; the import-export bank.  The fact you've never heard of it proves how stupid this is.  The import-export bank essentially is a short term loan bank for companies that want to invest in american companies.  It's a extremely limited bank and has little to no effect on anything; it's just a short term loan bank.  Republicans are trying to shut down the entire government over a bank that unimportant.  You know what's stupid about it as well?  If the bank was shut down 250k people would lose their jobs.\r\n\r\nSo basically Republicans are making a shitstorm out of a molehill. . .
