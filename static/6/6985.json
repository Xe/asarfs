If the majority of their franchises become multiplatform in the long run you wouldn't really be missing anything if they discontinue the xbox line of consoles.  The only big name you would really be missing is halo.  Out of all the games for xboxone only 37 out of the 400 are xbox exclusive.\r\n\r\nNintendo's next device is probably going to be a portable device with wiiu games available for download in the eshop.\r\n\r\n\r\nI don't know what playstation is going to do, cause initially ps4 was by far the best selling console but lately the hype is fizzling.  They essentially jizzed hard and fast and now they've gone flaccid.  They might or might not make a ps5 depending on if the sales continue to decline.\r\n\r\nTl:dr; more than likely there won't be a wiiu2 but instead wiiu games shoved to their next device's eshop; microsoft is already trying to kill the xboxone by shoving all their games to crossplatform/pc so by the time the xboxone is retired we won't be missing anything; ps4 we'll have to wait and see.\r\n\r\nTl:dr of Tl:dr; probably no new nintendo or microsoft console; wait and see for sony.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"558715f463687217480005a9","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"got xenoverse\r\nmade soacegerp\r\n!http://i869.photobucket.com/albums/ab259/potatosoup/spacegerp_zpsxryh1rcj.png!\r\nshe's a watermelon  ","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"558716806368722265002d47","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Also dayum Żubrówka with apple juice is gud ","author":"5007bbdf7f123b112f00023a"},{"id":"55871ccb6368724a4100008b","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/558715f463687217480005a9#post_558715f463687217480005a9\r\n~Time to ship her with Dumplin~ ","author":"50c204917f123b31440000a5"},{"id":"55871cd66368724182000121","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!https://data.archive.moe/board/m/image/1252/31/1252311760513.gif!\r\nSo there's a Ginguiser game on Android and IOS...","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"55871e3e63687227c0000ddb","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55871cd66368724182000121#post_55871cd66368724182000121\r\nwoah what?\r\n\r\nAlso, Jesus Christ what did he do?
