The Hulk can yield more damage than a thermonuclear bomb. But without anyone of the nuclear fallout. If someone managed to take control of Hulk (and it HAS happened) they would have a creature no weapon on the planet could stop. Hell that's why Wolverine was initially sent to kill Hulk. Because his adamantium claws can cut through Hulk's bulletproof skin. It's also why the Illuminati sent him to another planet during Civil War.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"55706a9a6368722e8b803b00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/557069136368723c5d800200#post_557069136368723c5d800200\r\nthe Illuminati sent Hulk to another planet...\r\n\r\nfor some reason i find that incredibly surreal ","author":"4ffbfff37f123b072a01bb5b"},{"id":"55706aec6368723c5dec0300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/557069136368723c5d800200#post_557069136368723c5d800200\r\nThe Avengers part was by far the best.\r\nBut then, everyone began to treat him like trash and a weapon.
