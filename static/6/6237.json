However underneath that insanity lies a sense of subtlety with a suprisingly low amount of dialouge. Particularly in it's characterization. Characters in the film communicate with each other and by extension the audience less through words and more the expressions and actions. This low dialogue/high action ratio is reminiscent the cartoon Samurai Jack. Combine all that with a fast pace, clever camerawork, and fantastically over-the-top chase and fight scenes and you have a fun wild ride that won't insult your intelligence.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"555bd6ee6368724dbf9f1000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Thanotos Omega\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/555bd6ac63687223a4750200#post_555bd6ac63687223a4750200\r\n!http://memecrunch.com/meme/1SV1B/damnnnn/image.jpg!","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"555bd70e6368726facd10400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/555bd6eb63687206b05b0000#post_555bd6eb63687206b05b0000\r\nhot","author":"37e5b9d66361642500af5e00"},{"id":"555bd7116368726facd40400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/555bd6eb63687206b05b0000#post_555bd6eb63687206b05b0000\r\n\r\nIs it violent?","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"555bd7366368724dbf1d1100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@QuasarNova\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/555bd65d6368724dbfaa0f00#post_555bd65d6368724dbfaa0f00\r\nNo you don't.
