Like the entire tone of the game shifts in 10 seconds from \"shoot-em-up\" to \"survival\" and just the entire game you constantly getting your face pounded into the concrete reminding you that you're a non-threat to anything and the only reason why you're winning is you can use a quick-save button.\r\n\r\nLike, \"oh your parents bought you this game cause you're a five year old with shitty parents and they thought it was Call of Duty levels easy?

Lots of them. This is a phenomenon that has been happening since ancient time, thousands of fishing boats, cargo transporters, and military vessels have been lost. Many go down with no apparent cause at all, they are just sucked down into the abyss below. This area on the east flank of Poyang Lake in China’s Jiangxi province is also known as the “waters of death,” “devil horns,” and the “Bermuda Triangle of the East.” Some say that the ships are sunk by abnormal wind patterns, others say that it’s because of whirlpools, some say it’s magnetic fields causing lightening strikes, while others reach more ominous or mysterious conclusions.

It's basically telling the story of Sephiroth's fall from grace and Zack's demise. It also tells the origin story of the Buster Sword itself.
