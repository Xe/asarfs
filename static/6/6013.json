If he were to kick everyone else out and just be the nostalgia critic he would actually be making more money off it.  The nostalgia chick, linkara, etc actually cost his company more money than they actually bring in.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to internet reviewers for media every few years people get excited for the new fad thinking they'll be the next big thing, but it turns out that only a couple of people are financially successful and as a result the fad dies out.\r\n\r\nA long term example of this is looking at the 15 year financial trend for machinima; back in 2006 people were making tons of money off machinima, now the only people making money off machinima are roosterteeth, ross scott, daschboshitt and a handful of people.\r\n\r\n\r\nTl:dr;\r\nInternet, \"Oh wow!  A new thing that I can become the new internet popular person with and make a living off of!\"\r\n*too many people trying to get into the new thing*\r\nInternet, \"OH SHIT!  It turned out that I overestimated the financial revenue generated from this new thing and only a handful of people are actually making a living off it!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nExamples; machinima, webcomics, only a handful of internet reviewers make enough money to quit their day job; this is eventually going to happen to letsplayers where only the most popular ones like twobestfriends, markiplier and other people that popular continue to make a living off it whereas everyone else has to find a day job.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnfortunately doug walker will probably be always around, but in say five/ten years it will just be the nostalgia critic and the rest of channel awesome will no longer exist.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"554e8dfe6368721643aa3700","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/554e8dae63687261639a2800#post_554e8dae63687261639a2800\r\nYou can't resist rhe comfort of a bed.","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"554e8ea363687237157c0a00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/554e8dae63687261639a2800#post_554e8dae63687261639a2800\r\nI figured by your absence","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"554e8eab63687263a3770000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"This is why I prefer the cinema snob, he's a lot more, well not as popular and humble, and in my opinion funnier","author":"37e5b9d66361642500af5e00"},{"id":"554e8ec163687263a38e0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/554e8dae63687261639a2800#post_554e8dae63687261639a2800\r\nthe bed is your best friend and worst enemy ","author":"4ffbfff37f123b072a01bb5b"},{"id":"554e8ed963687263a3a20000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/554e8dae63687261639a2800#post_554e8dae63687261639a2800\r\n^bedslut^\r\n","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"554e8ee06368720a522d0d00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/554e8dae63687261639a2800#post_554e8dae63687261639a2800\r\nWell at least you didn't miss Jontron with us yet!\r\n\r\nHe still hasn't uploaded it.\r\n\r\n\r\n","author":"50c204917f123b31440000a5"},{"id":"554e8ee26368726163702a00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Morning people","author":"4fdef063945b700a9d01604f"},{"id":"554e8f2363687237150c0b00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@AppleJackFrost\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/554e8ee26368726163702a00#post_554e8ee26368726163702a00\r\nAfternoon squidder","author":"9ba2e84e636164642cc03200"},{"id":"554e8f23636872124c5a0300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Number1pegasus\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/554e8ee06368720a522d0d00#post_554e8ee06368720a522d0d00\r\nReally?!
