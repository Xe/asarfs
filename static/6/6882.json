The \"self\" you recognize as self is nothing more than a memetic idea that is capable of recognizing it's own individual unit given to it by the memetic transfer of knowledge and information into it's self; ironically even though this memetic transfer of information is vital for the individual units to function interest groups reject the transfer of information that they deem to be outside of their own memetic ideas of \"comfort\" while hypocritically spreading their own.\r\n\r\nI was going to make it longer, but I think that was long enough to give a Tl:dr; version.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"557f008663687234d7001d05","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"1984 is awesome, ive never been a huge book reader but that book along with Lord of the Flies, Rumble Fish and To Kill A Mockingbird are some of the few books id say that are worth going through even if you dont normally have the patience for books","author":"4ffbfff37f123b072a01bb5b"},{"id":"557f01a76368720d08000ee3","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Speaking of communism:\r\n!http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/978/538/e56.png!","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"557f03a763687218c4001b9d","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/557eff2a63687234d7001ac2#post_557eff2a63687234d7001ac2\r\n[bq]\r\nYou should read Flowers for Algernon, 1984, Catcher in the Rye, Gaia, The Laughing Man and so forth.\r\n\r\n[/bq]\r\n\r\nI have read none of those.\r\n","author":"5007bbdf7f123b112f00023a"},{"id":"557f03dc63687233e900266f","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Kaz\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/557eeacb6368726db4000e10#post_557eeacb6368726db4000e10\r\nI saw that\r\n\r\n^~ich bin nacht Deutsch~^\r\n\r\nOtherwise accurate","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"557f04126368720d080011d4","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Brosuke is the fucking best.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"557f042f6368720cfe001467","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/557f03dc63687233e900266f#post_557f03dc63687233e900266f\r\n[bq=\"Too_Offensive\"]\"@Kaz\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/557eeacb6368726db4000e10#post_557eeacb6368726db4000e10\r\n\r\n\r\n^~ich bin nacht Deutsch~^\r\n[/bq]\r\nYou are night german?","author":"5007bbdf7f123b112f00023a"},{"id":"557f047063687233e900278b","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/557f04126368720d080011d4#post_557f04126368720d080011d4\r\nHe is!
