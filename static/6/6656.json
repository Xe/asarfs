Essentially that whoever is in the top circle decides where the movement goes.  The problem with these sorts of movements is that for the most part they are comprised primarily of younger generations of people and that if you have movements comprised primarily of younger generations of people then they lose interest much faster than older generations of people; essentially if you have a movement of people primarily under the age of 25 they tend to quit within a couple years and only a few of them stay for long.\r\n\r\nI think you know your movement is dying cause otherwise you wouldn't be running recruitment in a forum that hates your ideology; your latest attempts at trying to get people to join your movement is about as desperate as a republican trying to get democrats in the democratic national convention to vote republican.  The reason why your movement is dying is because it's no longer receiving new recruits in enough numbers for a long term stable membership.\r\n\r\nYour ideology is going to be dead in ten years cause everybody hates your ideology.\r\n\"In 2013 23% of americans considered themselves feminists\":https://today.yougov.com/news/2013/05/01/has-feminist-become-dirty-word/\r\n\"In 2015 only 18%\":http://www.vox.com/2015/4/8/8372417/feminist-gender-equality-poll\r\n\r\nThe math is pretty simple here:\r\n(23-18)/2=2.5% of the general population per year less call themselves that; 18%/2.5% per year = 7.2 years\r\n\r\nYou *KNOW* that it's dying cause if you honestly didn't think it was then you wouldn't be trying this fucking hard to try to get people that you know hate it to join your little group.\r\n\r\nTl:dr; *NOBODY* here is interested; either shut up or fuck off cause everyone is fucking tired about you making every last thread about you trying to get people to join your cult.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"557203fb6368724402a10400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Speaking of Immortan joe.\r\n\r\nLook on Amazon for  something called Wilton Silver color Mist\r\n\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Wilton-710-5521-Silver-Color-Mist/dp/B005KTVG86\r\n\r\nYou will not be disappointed at the reviews.","author":"500757fd7f123b75a90003b1"},{"id":"5572044863687244020b0500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Princess♠Molestia\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/557203fb6368724402a10400#post_557203fb6368724402a10400\r\nWe've *WITNESSED* them before.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"5572047d63687240b78e0500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5572044863687244020b0500#post_5572044863687244020b0500\r\n!http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/dragoncity/images/6/6b/I_See_What_You_Did_There_Meme.png/revision/latest?cb=20140329042847!","author":"500757fd7f123b75a90003b1"},{"id":"557204bf6368724402c30500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Princess♠Molestia\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5572047d63687240b78e0500#post_5572047d63687240b78e0500\r\nIf I were of a more lithe body type and were willing to shave my body hair, which I am not, I would sooooooo cosplay asa War Boy.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"5572050463687240960e0700","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/557204bf6368724402c30500#post_557204bf6368724402c30500\r\nI hope they become the new stormtroopers as far as cosplay trends go ","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"5572050d6368720173701600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/557204bf6368724402c30500#post_557204bf6368724402c30500\r\nman if youve got chest hair like i do shaving that shit is a bad idea\r\n\r\ni had the bad idea one time and was like \"how would this look\"\r\n\r\nshirts itched for a month afterwards","author":"50a843d47f123b2e7c001359"},{"id":"557205296368720622c91500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@hype\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/557203a86368720173961300#post_557203a86368720173961300\r\n[bq=\"hype\"]\"@Kaz\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/557202d063687240b7fc0200#post_557202d063687240b7fc0200\r\nnot that much it doesnt\r\n\r\nidk how youre keeping the jammy thing going for so long though, id get bored playing like this[/bq]\r\n\r\nhttps://soundcloud.com/nullinput/some-lead-soloingimprovisation skip to 1:30","author":"37e5b9d66361642500af5e00"}]}
