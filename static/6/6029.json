What we do have to worry about is a local star a couple light years from us going supernova though.  If a star close to us were to go supernova it would usher in a severe ice age.  Considering the stars that are close to us the worst case scenario is a ice age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat we do have to worry about is that in certain parts of the galaxy there's large amounts of dust.  You know how the asteroid field is mainly just insanely large dust clusters?  Imagine how large the dust cluster for the milk way is?  If the earth were to come in contact with one of these dust clusters we would be done for and would *HAVE* to move to space.  Imagine a metric meter of dust collecting on the earth monthly on average. . . I don't mean that as total; rather I mean at the end of the month the dust would be a meter deep; next month it would be another meter deep and it would continue for thousands of years of continuously collecting that much dust.\r\n\r\nWe probably don't have to worry about this one though, cause it's never happened to the earth previously; if it did happen simply put life on earth would be extinct.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"554fcc2a6368727f408b0d00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/554fcba3636872123e190c00#post_554fcba3636872123e190c00\r\nSpace is scary.","author":"500757fd7f123b75a90003b1"},{"id":"554fcc6b6368722317c31100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@QuasarNova\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/554fc9f26368727f400a0b00#post_554fc9f26368727f400a0b00\r\n[bq=\"QuasarNova\"]\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/554fc8636368727f40370900#post_554fc8636368727f40370900\r\n\r\nPretty sure this is a dumb question but is the theory that neutrinos could mitigate the shockwave somewhat?[/bq]\r\nNo; when a star collapses the forces to keep the star intact are no longer strong enough to counteract the forces that pull it apart.  We don't have to worry about our sun going supernova though; it will just become a brown dwarf.  However what we would have to worry about is when it starts dying before it becomes a brown dwarf it will expand and eventually swallow the earth and then it will shrink.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"554fcd7d636872123e7b0e00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"So without reading I'm assuming that space is so scientifically impossible to comprehend there is shit that can wipe us off the universal map in a matter of seconds but for some *GIFT OF GOD* it just doesn't. \r\n","author":"50c204917f123b31440000a5"},{"id":"554fce186368720a5f690a00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Number1pegasus\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/554fcd7d636872123e7b0e00#post_554fcd7d636872123e7b0e00\r\n\r\nThat Gift of god is known as probability, but yeah, proof that anything remotely black is out to destroy us\r\n\r\n[spoiler]Buy your pitchforks and torches here: 001-555-R4C15T[/spoiler]","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"554fce866368727f409d1000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/554fcc6b6368722317c31100#post_554fcc6b6368722317c31100\r\nThat wouldn't happen for another billions of years.
