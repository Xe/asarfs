I semi-quit cause there's only three schools of art anyone gives a shit about anymore: photo-realism, \"modern art\" and anime.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, I like anime and photo-realism but do people only ever have to give a crap about these three?\r\n\r\nThe reason why I stopped was because first I went for a art competition and they only gave awards to modern art and the majority of the attendees cared about that.  Then I kept getting bad grades in my classes cause I refused to do photo-realism or modern art.  The response by the teachers was \"I think composition wise it's good, but the art style is so last century.  You need to be hip and trendy!  I can't give you a good grade until you drop that so last century trend!\"\r\n\r\nI eventually got so frustrated that I tore up every piece of art I did, except for one.  The only piece of art I ever got any sort of appreciation for was a semi-photorealistic drawing of a woman that I drew in 30 seconds cause I was getting in such trouble for drawing what I wanted that I had to draw something photo-realistic fail the class.\r\n\r\nI've grown to hate photo-realism cause it's too easy; it's too easy to just copy what you see.  You shouldn't be forced to draw what people want you to simply cause they think modern art is \"hip and now\".\r\n\r\n\r\nHonestly it really hurts how hipsters have taken control of art, cause I will never amount to anything art wise cause I'm not doing what's \"trendy\" and just like to draw what I want.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5586132f6368727b0e0015a9","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!https://31.media.tumblr.com/8d82f2269d1b42c457b6d7e7b14bf76d/tumblr_mx0h91x2jn1qivqtjo1_400.gif!\r\n!https://38.media.tumblr.com/b039a6af9c1258535aecace79f37a1fa/tumblr_ms9on8l12v1rqbjyuo1_250.gif!\r\nReminder that Taiyou Sentai Sun Vulcan is the best.","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"558613526368723558001254","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/558528ba6368723b21001dbd#post_558528ba6368723b21001dbd\r\n[bq=\"trashboat\"]\"@hype\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/558517246368720f3e001c76#post_558517246368720f3e001c76\r\n!http://i.imgur.com/UqytXto.png!\r\nFound one of them.[/bq]\r\nGood\r\n\r\nAt least I'll still have Lapis at the bottom of the sea\r\n\r\n\"@SeraphimDawn\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5584eb3b63687219e9001fec#post_5584eb3b63687219e9001fec\r\n[bq=\"SeraphimDawn\"]!https://derpicdn.net/img/view/2013/8/25/410375__safe_rarity_animated_smile_equestria+girls_upvotes+galore_open+mouth_eyes+closed_ass_dancing.gif![/bq]\r\n!//derpicdn.net/img/2014/1/15/524823/medium.gif!:/524823\r\n\r\n\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/558500a56368725c7a001be4#post_558500a56368725c7a001be4\r\n[bq=\"mariomarc\"]YO\r\n\r\n!https://38.media.tumblr.com/d7830586ffa8734e180f1a6deb566d46/tumblr_npx906KSiw1r5lk82o1_540.gif![/bq]\r\nI saw a Splatoon cosplay on launch day actually","author":"9ba2e84e636164642cc03200"},{"id":"558613576368727b0e0015ef","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://news.tfw2005.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2015/06/Voyager-Binary-Armor-OP-Robot.jpg!\r\n!http://news.tfw2005.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2015/06/Warrior-Gold-Armor-Grimlock-Dino.jpg!\r\n!http://news.tfw2005.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2015/06/B5609_Sky-Reign-Combined.jpg!\r\n!http://news.tfw2005.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2015/06/Combiner_Bruticus.jpg!\r\n_they're beautifuunuuuul_","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"5586135e6368726f86000326","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Kaz\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/558612cc63687272f300177e#post_558612cc63687272f300177e\r\n\r\nIt resembles more a man holding a spear","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"5586138c636872463c000a67","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Pasta should stop being so good.\r\nMy stomach hurts now.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"5586138d6368727b0e001636","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5586132f6368727b0e0015a9#post_5586132f6368727b0e0015a9\r\n[bq=\"trashboat\"]!https://31.media.tumblr.com/8d82f2269d1b42c457b6d7e7b14bf76d/tumblr_mx0h91x2jn1qivqtjo1_400.gif!\r\n!https://38.media.tumblr.com/b039a6af9c1258535aecace79f37a1fa/tumblr_ms9on8l12v1rqbjyuo1_250.gif!\r\nReminder that Taiyou Sentai Sun Vulcan is the best.[/bq]\r\n\r\nFUCKING BAD LUCK.
