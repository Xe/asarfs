The physicists kept explaining to them that if a black hole was created the micro black hole would only exist for a couple hundred atto seconds, but the idiots heard the word \"micro black hole\" and thought that meant planet earth destroying.\r\n\r\nThe thing is though that the existence of paradoxes means that human logic is flawed and that physics often flies head first into the face of logic.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5574c42e6368726c7e000380","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5574c3f16368725d7b000aa7#post_5574c3f16368725d7b000aa7\r\nKnowledge is revelatory.

In Weimar Germany, nationalists had all three - mostly relics of the Wilhelmine government - on their side. Denazification reversed this. Today in Europe, antifas can beat up their opponents with a wink and a nod from the authorities, whereas neo-Nazis get the book thrown at them. \r\n\r\nThe answer: duh.
