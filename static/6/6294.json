People will still have real life friends; just rather than going to their house to hang out and watch a movie the norm might shift towards instead them hanging out on video games and them hanging out in real life to a considerable less degree.  Essentially them hanging out in real life only a couple hours a week but them spending most of their time online together instead; they'll still go to the movies to watch Avengers or that, but the second they come back they go \"see you in five minutes\" they really mean \"I'll log on in five minutes\" and their \"hanging out\" time for the rest of the day is them playing games together instead of physically hanging out.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt depends really; there hasn't been any long term studies into the long run effects on vr on people, but so far things are pointing towards when it coming out whatever effect it has it will drastically change things socially.  The question is \"just how addictive is it in the long run?\"  We know that it's highly addictive, we just don't know how hard will it be for people to resist it in the long run.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"555e565e636872594a420600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"Dis crazy bitch just went and brought and opened 300 Advanced Supply Drops\":https://youtu.be/tbf4Tr8RjIA\r\nDat sound of happiness when he gets the ones he want.","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"555e56a96368727c7fa60b00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/555e4f57636872766aff2400#post_555e4f57636872766aff2400\r\nYou have friends?","author":"5012e49c7f123b4012000341"},{"id":"555e56e463687226f15d0300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@ArcticEight\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/555e56a96368727c7fa60b00#post_555e56a96368727c7fa60b00\r\noh snap","author":"5007bbdf7f123b112f00023a"},{"id":"555e570d63687226f1920300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/555e56156368727c7f9e0a00#post_555e56156368727c7f9e0a00\r\nI hate to be the one to tell you this Uc9, but you are now that guy who accuses rock of being of the devil, you got old and are now afraid of new things,","author":"509f70a87f123b77eb0004fd"},{"id":"555e57496368727f45d61100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/555e56156368727c7f9e0a00#post_555e56156368727c7f9e0a00\r\nWell for me, majority of my social life is online\r\nYou guys\r\nSo mot much change for me","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"555e57846368727c7f490d00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Thanotos Omega\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/555e55a56368725222410600#post_555e55a56368725222410600\r\nOkay.
