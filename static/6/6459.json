You know how like fifteen years ago prepubescent teenagers weren't *just* interested in generic fps shooter games but interested in all sorts of games?  Basically that.\r\n\r\nWe *might* see a new golden age of gaming cause the games that are super popular right now, games like LoL or minecraft or such, companies can not even close to compete against even if they try to do the scummy thing of making cheap ripoffs so that might force companies to actually try to innovate with their games.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"55660f2b63687245ffc30f00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@EHAN\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55660e176368720eae690300#post_55660e176368720eae690300\r\nI say Y'all from time to time.
