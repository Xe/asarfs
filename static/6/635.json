Would like to hear your thoughts. Although you won't like him.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYxCBi7ySPw\r\n\r\nHis accent is kinda meh though.\r\n\r\nI don't agree on everything but I do agree with the general sentiment.\r\n\r\n[/bq]\r\nOkay; I'm going to have to stop this video on several accounts: a completely free market actually makes monopolies more likely; the collapse of the ussr was due to several reasons, but mainly due overspending with a pure type of market is a bad idea in that 100% pure economic policies are a bad idea and that the best type of economic practice is a hybrid of capitalism, socialism and communist ideas when need be; a monopoly comes about due to economic reasons not how good their product is; the lack of flexibility of large businesses is often instable financially, but not always depending on how well it's ran.  That's just the first two and a half minutes.\r\n\r\nThe reason why privatizing nationalized companies often fails is that it's done crappily 99% of the time.  The USSR was never that big financially and was doomed to fail because they tried short term financial policies to boost their economy in the long run.  Most of Russia's economic growth is from rebuilding financially and will peter out eventually in much the same way that many first world countries experienced decades of massive economic growth then plateaud out; which brings that to another point infinite exponential economic growth is a physical impossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n. . . . I'm not going to touch the second half cause that's straight up tinfoil hat conspiracy territory and I'm not going to touch that with a ten foot pole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere's some good news:\r\nA federal court ruled gay marriage unconstitutional; it's going to a appeals, but this covers Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Utah and Wyoming.  While it's still unlikely it will go to the supreme court it would in one foul swoop legalize gay marriage in six states.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53abae08636872654eb80000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Whatevs\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53abac4e636872639b6a0000#post_53abac4e636872639b6a0000\r\nIts more that they're just working with the materials and tools that they have on hand, same with all improvised weapons.","author":"4f41ee04945b701c41002af7"},{"id":"53abb06763687263840c0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://38.media.tumblr.com/4ee033a965268caf437a560e5a4e73a5/tumblr_n7qynfoUzb1r2lahno1_1280.png!","author":"4fe3f3d07f123b5170000d0d"},{"id":"53abb09c636872650a2e0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Let's do role call!
