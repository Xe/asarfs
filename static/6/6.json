Even if you don't live in the usa they can still do stuff like seizing your ip address or deny you to have any level of access to the internet through any channel that a american company owns.  So if they want to seriously get rid of you using the internet they can.  Just look at what happened to the megaupload guy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nActually speaking of same-sex marriage it *MAY* become legalized in the usa throughout sometime soon.  The reason being with doma they couldn't find a legal basis for it, but punted it back to the states.  Well it's coming right back to the supreme court again cause of utah.  Even if they punt it back to the states no matter how they rule it will follow what happened with doma and how the number of states where it was legalized as a result increased.\r\n\r\nSo basically same-sex marriage is heading right back to the supreme court; so either A) Even more states will legalize it or B) It will become legal throughout the usa(This is actually more likely since they couldn't find any legal grounds for doma last time they ruled on it)","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"52d5fde66368726777f90100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://www.pleated-jeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Screen-shot-2013-05-16-at-9.32.52-AM.jpg!","author":"5037a9f87f123b3532002e58"},{"id":"52d5ffd16368724bb9850200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@PonyCat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/52d5fde66368726777f90100#post_52d5fde66368726777f90100\r\ncats are the masters of wasting time","author":"4fe16df67f123b13e400003f"},{"id":"52d5fffc6368724386440300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Whatevs\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/52d5ffd16368724bb9850200#post_52d5ffd16368724bb9850200\r\n\r\nThey even make us waste time","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"52d600aa636872370eae0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://www.pleated-jeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/kym-1.jpg!","author":"5037a9f87f123b3532002e58"},{"id":"52d6193563687236586e0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-T9o-2zOShLQ/UtYGXdxZASI/AAAAAAAA0VA/br_cdV7G5dg/w720-h558-no/Black+Wolf+Hybrid+%2528Wolfdog%2529.jpg!\r\n\r\nNow that's a dog.","author":"4fe4bf947f123b175b000001"},{"id":"52d61a266368725c4e4e0300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@AaronMk\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/52d6193563687236586e0000#post_52d6193563687236586e0000\r\nAre you sure?","author":"4fddff15945b706cf6000520"},{"id":"52d61a686368727762d00100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@PonyPon\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/52d61a266368725c4e4e0300#post_52d61a266368725c4e4e0300\r\nhe was bred with a jackal","author":"4fe16df67f123b13e400003f"},{"id":"52d61aee6368724575150100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Whatevs\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/52d61a686368727762d00100#post_52d61a686368727762d00100\r\nOf course.","author":"4fddff15945b706cf6000520"},{"id":"52d6741763687209b8e30600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@AaronMk\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/52d6193563687236586e0000#post_52d6193563687236586e0000\r\nWe don't actually know if the dog is big, she could just be really small","author":"4fe16df67f123b13e400003f"},{"id":"52d6a21d6368724c582e0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Whatevs\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/52d6741763687209b8e30600#post_52d6741763687209b8e30600\r\n\r\nThe girl does look fairly small.
