Apparently, to make the growth of these neck lumps less likely, I was for some reason required to hold her in a very tight and intimate hug, bite her neck and drink her blood for its medicinal properties. But I tasted it and decided a) that it was far too sour, and b) that I didn't particularly want to drink anyone's blood anyway. So I took a tiny shred of tissue out of my pocket (at least, I presume that's where I got it from - at the time it kind of just appeared in my hand,) and held it to her neck - somehow stopping the bleeding.\r\n\r\nI don't remember what happened next, but I do remember going around and telling everyone about it. Twice. Then  I woke up and realised I could still remember the texture of the dragoness' skin. (She was a bit clammy.)\r\n\r\nMaybe my brain is trying to tell me something, but I can't for the life of me figure out what it might be.","author":"52f5159b6368721440260300"},{"id":"5557227c63687212909f0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@BrownieComicWriter\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55571b2a636872627b401100#post_55571b2a636872627b401100\r\nIt's actually easy to understand dreams as they are all based on something you've seen, thought or experienced. You will never have a dream of something that was never known in your life.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet's see... Lumps, dragoness, blood drinking, sour taste and for some weird and unknown reason, spreading of experience to people. \r\n\r\nLumps can be based on a lot of thing actually. Maybe LSP from Adventure Time or an actual disease that exists (but more or less severe in your dream). It can even be based on a mosquito bite but enlarged in your dream.\r\n\r\nThe drinking of blood from a dragon is probably based on vampirism or dragon blood rituals where they drink or bathe dragon's blood for unique magical abilities. The dragoness came because you felt attracted to her or find her interesting.\r\n\r\nThe sour taste would be your view on medicine. Medicine is usually bitter but may sometimes be sour if you eat it with something else. When the doctor said it was medicine, the blood (labeled as medicine in your subconscious) tasted terrible to you. If he didn't say it was medicine or maybe just some erotic dream, you wouldn't taste it like that since you'd think differently.\r\n\r\nTelling everyone about your weird day is a common thing in real life. you just had an uncommon experience so you tell people about it to make yourself look interesting or because it looks interesting, like telling someone about a good book.","author":"4fe1b9f47f123b13df002976"},{"id":"55572c746368720693810100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5556ebe2636872608d270e00#post_5556ebe2636872608d270e00\r\nthat is one cheeky little perverted kitty","author":"4ffbfff37f123b072a01bb5b"},{"id":"55572d386368724fc1320500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Morning.","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"55572e1a63687212902b0d00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Carcass Strife\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/55572d386368724fc1320500#post_55572d386368724fc1320500\r\nAfternoon","author":"5007bbdf7f123b112f00023a"}]}
