But I very much doubt that most of what you said is the actual reason behind the dream.\r\n\r\n1. The lumps weren't like any real-life disease. Think of two ping-pong balls at the base of your neck, at the front, under the skin. That was what it was like. I honestly don't think I've ever been bitten by a mosquito; one tried once, but I felt it poking me and flicked it away before it actually penetrated my skin. And that was _years_ ago.\r\n\r\n2. As for the blood, I didn't know anything about those kind of rituals, even that they existed, so the dream couldn't possibly have been based on them. However... now that I think about it, the blood tasted like \"blood orange\":http://www.tarasmulticulturaltable.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/blood-orange-1-of-1.jpg juice, not medicine - and I had been thinking about blood oranges a day or two ago. My brain must have just made the connection.\r\n\r\n3. As for the dragoness, well... you're right there. It wouldn't take Einstein to figure that one out.","author":"52f5159b6368721440260300"},{"id":"5557381563687212900c1b00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@BrownieComicWriter\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/555736e0636872358d6b2300#post_555736e0636872358d6b2300\r\nWhat he said holds true.
