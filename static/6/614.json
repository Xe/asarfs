When I first came out my dad couldn't believe it. I was worried about how my grandad would react but when I told him all he did was give me the biggest hug I've ever had. He said to me \"You are my grandson and nothing will change that.\" However one weekend I went to his house with a black eye. I don't think I need to tell you how I got it. My grandad drove over to my house, grabbed my dad by the neck , and said \"If you ever lay another hand on that boy I will sodomize you with a rusty straight razor.\"","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"53a8d11b6368724692f80000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53a8d0cd6368725f7a6a0400#post_53a8d0cd6368725f7a6a0400\r\n\r\nBadass grandpa is badass","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"53a8d186636872176b410300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53a8d0cd6368725f7a6a0400#post_53a8d0cd6368725f7a6a0400\r\nDamn.

What I mean by this is hypothetically if they kept minimum wage at $8/hour and there was no inflation you would be only working ten hours a week, but the cost of products will be much cheaper to the point where you're still on the same financial standing.\r\n\"@twistedmetalero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53a8df2763687276938b0200#post_53a8df2763687276938b0200\r\nPretty much; Futurama, even though it's a comedy, is hilariously accurate.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53a8e0226368722b0a760400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://38.media.tumblr.com/6a36b16ee6992196f294a4993a2a11c0/tumblr_n7eu7oqWme1sa5stto1_1280.jpg!\r\nWhat is wrong with this picture?","author":"50b70eeb7f123b1a02000097"},{"id":"53a8e09d6368722b0a980400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@PaskaNaakka\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53a8de276368726b47a40000#post_53a8de276368726b47a40000\r\nSwedes never fail to impress me with their unique sense of design.
