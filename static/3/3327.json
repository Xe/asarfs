Basically imagine a 2000 square foot house 100% complete with wiring, insulation and everything for only $5000 brand new.

Imagine cars costing a quarter of their current price or electronics for much cheaper.\r\n\r\nThe reason why it has people terrified is because what might happen is a rapid devaluing of houses with everyone wanting to get 3d printed houses because of their cheap price might cause another housing crash.
