Well I just accidentally made myself feel like shit tonight through video games.\r\n\r\nIf you're wondering how it's cause of Fallout 3; if you choose to save Megaton City your dad when at the water treatment experiment will say that he's proud of you and say that you're a good person.  The reason why this made me feel like shit is that I've never been told this by anyone, except for whenever they utterly fuck up as a person and do something horrible and they tell me this as a cheap way of getting out of feeling bad about themselves as a person.  I have never been told that I'm a good person or that anyone's proud of me by someone that hasn't hurt me emotionally offline; all of the times I've been told this is that it's been by someone that was screaming profanities, calling me a \"faggot\" or insulting me in some way and them realizing that they've done something horrible so they try to get out of feeling horrible about how they've acted by going \"you're a good person\".\r\n\r\nI try to be a good person, but all my family sees is that I don't have kids already and the one's that know all they see is \"oh uc9 is bi that means I'm not getting grandkids\"/\"uc9 is trans that means I'm not getting grandkids\"/\"uc9 wants to wait to start a family cause he's had a couple shit relationships so he's waiting to find someone he actually loves so I'm not getting grandkids right this second\"/\"Oh well you can't ever be a good person cause it's never good enough\"/\"you can't be a good person cause even though you're paying your rent because you don't have a car/higher paying job/my own house/<insert scapegoat reason to paint me as a bad person> that means he's a bad person\".\r\n\r\nI try to be a good person; even though our family has a extreme biological impulse to hurt others I resist that thought in the back of my mind that says it's okay to harm others and legitimately care about people.  No matter what I do I can never be in anyone's eyes a good person simply because I'm bi/trans/don't have kids/don't have a car/don't have a house/ -don't have a job- (this one is scratched off the list because I have a job now).  The way the people around me quantify what a good person is someone that's straight, has kids, has a car and has a house and people wonder why I struggle with mental problems because if that is what is quantified as a \"good\" person then I can never be good no matter what I do.\r\n\r\nTl:dr; my family quantifies what defines a good person as someone that's straight, has kids, has a house, has a job, has a car and because I'm not straight I can never be a good person to them.\r\n\r\n!http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/167/100/tumblr_loal57yTbj1qbnd1c.gif!","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54d7f31d63687230d00b1900","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Whatevs\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54d7f0b56368722d49cb1900#post_54d7f0b56368722d49cb1900\r\nThe Avatar universe is a different place.","author":"505696b47f123b37e800effa"},{"id":"54d7f3de63687255a53e0f00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54d7f3066368722891340700#post_54d7f3066368722891340700\r\nDude\r\nFuck your family\r\n\r\nYou are a good person, and they clearly can't appreciate what they have\r\n\r\nIf it's an consolation, I love you man, I think you're great \r\n\r\n*hug*","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"54d7f47063687242fc010300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54d7f3066368722891340700#post_54d7f3066368722891340700\r\nDude.
