Somehow. Again. What the fcuk\r\n\r\nIn other news, my dad snuck into my room while I was at school and tried to \"fix\" the hinge on my laptop. Now I can't even close it. His fix is literally putting a binder clip on the screen to keep it stable, and he re-attached the hinge, but now it won't close right without making an awful snapping sound every time I try.\r\n\r\nSo basically he made me hate this laptop even more, which I didn't think was possible. I tried un-doing his \"fix,\" but I couldn't without everything almost falling apart. My laptop is on its last stretch of life, one wrong move and I'll need a replacement.","author":"9ba2e84e636164642cc03200"},{"id":"54b9957a6368725ca2bb0300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@EHAN\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54b9952a6368724fc73d0300#post_54b9952a6368724fc73d0300\r\nDad, sthap trying.","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"54b995a2636872608d280200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@EHAN\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54b9952a6368724fc73d0300#post_54b9952a6368724fc73d0300\r\nAt the risk of playing Devil's Advocate.\r\nAt least he tried to help.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54b995d46368725aaed70200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"So the supreme court is going to decide on gay marriage; they're going to hear arguments in April and decide by June.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54b995e3636872558a4b0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Heading home \r\nComputer parts are all at home now\r\nYeah\r\n\r\nAlso was watching JoJo last night\r\nCyborg Nazi","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"54b996086368725c35e10100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54b995e3636872558a4b0200#post_54b995e3636872558a4b0200\r\nGERMAN SCIENCE!","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54b99628636872511c870200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\r\nguess who got a new Monitor!\r\n\r\nThis thing is fucking bright though like jesus Christ.
