And then we have a water based coolant but it's mists up the room and that's worse then the smoke. But it doesn't matter because the metal chips are still hot. Some have smoke trails when they fly off, it's cool because it's like little mortars until they land on you... That's usually when I start flailing around my arms. They instantly burn you. But that's most only with steel, aluminum is easy to cut and brass is fun as hell to cut. Both soft metals.\r\nBut all chips will be sharp no matter what.\r\nOops I typed a lot...","author":"51a2815b7f123be59500049b"}]}
