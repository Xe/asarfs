Thank god Mikasa and Pixis were able to talk sense into them and stop their BS from causing any damage or harm to anyone. But seriously, screw those guys. I hope Titans find them and eat them.[/spoiler]\r\n\r\n[spoiler]And Marco's dead. Well...crap.\r\nHe wasn't one of my favorites, but I did like him and I though he had potential and would laster longer. What I did like and remember out of him while he lasted, was his knightly and level-headed personality, and I did like his friendship with Jean. I don't think he was a great fighter, but he could keep up and had potential for growth.\r\nBut he's officially the first casualty out of the Top 10 of the 104th. Rest in peace, dude.\r\nOne down, nine more to go.[/spoiler]\r\n\r\nAnd now the Survey Corps people have showed up. So far, I'm looking into the eccentric Hange, and of course, the ever-popular stoic Levi. Hope they can win me over. Especially if Levi CAN outdo both Mikasa and Eren [spoiler]in Titan form[/spoiler], if what I've been told both in-show and outside.\r\nBut why in the heck does Hange seem so dang similar to Sasha, except..._smarter, and much more deadly?_ This really weirds me out...\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Eren:\r\n[spoiler]!http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130630011312/shingekinokyojin/images/2/2e/Eren_carries_the_boulder.png!\r\nDAT ATLAS REFERENCE\r\nAND THE MUSIC THAT WAS PLAYING DURING THAT SCENE\r\nSO FREAKING AWESOME AND BEAUTIFUL[/spoiler]\r\n\r\nWell I'm done raving about Attack on Titan for now.
