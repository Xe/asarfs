For best results, we recommend using a hard drive with its own power supply that connects to the Wii U via the USB port on the console.\r\nCommercial Flash memory has a limit on the number of times you can write over it and we don't recommend flash memory devices for long-term storage of important save data.[/bq]\r\n\r\nSo....
