The problem is that Unix is open source and accounts for 60% of all the servers in the world so in order the internet to comply Unix would have to open source the backdoor.  Imagine putting a backdoor into a operating system, now imagine showing everyone on the entire fucking internet how to get into any computer that uses it.\r\n\r\nTo put it blunt Obama's a fucking idiot because that would give anyone with access to google unrestricted access to the vast majority of servers.  To make it even more blunt imagine showing the world how to use the backdoors for our nuclear arsenal and showing the world how to have unrestricted access to them.\r\n\r\nTl:dr; Obama's a fucking idiot.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54bed5be6368722787703600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Carcass Strife\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54bed4fc63687264c6ad0200#post_54bed4fc63687264c6ad0200\r\nNo!\r\n\r\nThis is a kickstarter trailer, Kickstarters are on the internet. \r\n\r\nKickstarter is a site people recently started using.
