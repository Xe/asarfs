And seriously you need to stop it with this. You are seriously implying that eating organic food causes autism? Just because someone trying to discredit organic food found two graphs that seem to fit does not make it true. People have been eating organic food for thousands of years. Keep in mind organic the way food is supposed to be and the way we have been eating all up until a few decades ago.","author":"5010fa077f123b1e4f00104e"},{"id":"53891d1463687224aa310100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Randomosaur can you make a topic on organic food vs gmo or can you please stop trying to start shit?","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"53891d1a6368722225750100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53891c10636872244f380100#post_53891c10636872244f380100\r\n\r\nNope.

Why would you just link something like that without explanation of it? If you truly meant that graph to be an example that \"correlation does not equal causation\" then why didn't you say so instead of posting it in the context that makes it look like that graph was instead meant to be taken at face value and sparking this debate?\r\n\r\nSecond, the link I posted sources evidence that GMO's can indeed be dangerous, I may not have wrote the article but I do agree with most of it. You may say that article is nonsense and find sources to back it up but I can do the same.
