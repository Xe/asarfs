How would you react psychologically if there were multiple copies of you?\r\n\r\n\r\nLet's dial down the scifi a bit and talk about mass production humans.  With how 3d printing is looking at creating artificial organs there's the risk of potentially entire humans being copied or intentionally done so.  If you were copied could you handle the idea that you might not be the original?\r\nSide note: personally I think eventually mass production humans might become true as a means of the super rich believing that they can gain immortality from it; this you dies just replace him; that you dies just replace him.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54b5f8ae636872194faf0500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Does anyone know a good place to watch the Evangelion dub?
