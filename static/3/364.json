Awesome monster fight at the Honolulu airport? Ha! Nope, we're back to the bland, generic ass fucking family. One of the MUTO's wrecking Vegas? Yeah that would be cool, we'd better cut that out and only show you other character's watching it on some grainy monitors instead.\r\n\r\nThat said when Godzilla does show up to throw down shit gets goddamn awesome really goddamn fast.
