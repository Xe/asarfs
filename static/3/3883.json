Now this girl has a very special neurological disorder that can only described as ADD with a turbo. Her brain scans and process information waaaaay too fast. Unfortunately the transaction goes awry when an assassin decideds to crash the party and murder everyone. EXCEPT the girl. Instead he takes the girl and trains her as an assassin. He trains  her in his style of fighting, making special use of her special brain. He gives her a knife that contains a nearly limitless amount of pseudo-spider thread and she becomes an \"Arachnid.\" However you learn later that the only reason assassin guy took her in and trained her was so that she could kill him. She does. And after rejecting the organization the assassin used to work for, the organization decides to make her enemy number 1 and throws all sort of gimmicky assassins at her. All in all, it's a good action series with some fantastic artwork and really fun action scenes.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54d85c0b63687209fd041800","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54d85951636872070f760200#post_54d85951636872070f760200\r\nNeeeeaaaat! that sounds sick!
