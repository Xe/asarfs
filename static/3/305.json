Think of it as simple shapes; cube, circles, triangles. Start with the simple shapes and build up from there.*\r\n\r\nDon't be afraid to overlap shapes and lines.\r\n\r\nDrawing straight lines in place of rounded parts is helpful when making the initial image, curves can be added later. Though you can still use circles if you need.\r\n\r\nTake your time, learn what you need to do. Once you know how to build it initially it becomes easier.\r\n\r\nAnd don't think you have to have a perfectly clean line at first, if you need to draw a line twice to get it good, do that.\r\n\r\nUse reference. It helps alot.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd to continue my rant, some excercises that help with drawing art.\r\n\r\nPractice pencil handling by drawing 2 dots, then try to connect a line between the two in one stroke. Keep doing this until you get good at it, and move the dots farther apart as you improve. Eventually try to master pressure.\r\n\r\nDraw a big circle and try to connect the start to the end in one movement. Don't expect to get this right immediately. And then draw another circle and try to have it's edge touch the previous one. Keep doing this till your page is filled with circles.\r\n\r\nThese are mostly to help build a steady hand for drawing.\r\n\r\nAnd that's the end of my rant. I could keep going on about more stuff, but I'll stop there.\r\n\r\n","author":"500757fd7f123b75a90003b1"},{"id":"537a62826368721731040200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Princess♠Molestia\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/537a621663687217449b0100#post_537a621663687217449b0100\r\nThat along with this site I found on a google search is helping me understand more","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"537a63236368722fd5a30600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"Jurassic World news\":http://www.joblo.com/movie-news/exclusive-spoilery-details-on-jurassic-world-the-park-the-dinos-more ","author":"50b70eeb7f123b1a02000097"},{"id":"537a635f6368727628070300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/537a62826368721731040200#post_537a62826368721731040200\r\nIf you are really serious about getting good you may want to look into going to art classes.
