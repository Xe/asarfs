Since by the time they're going to make a ruling will start to get into the presidential election process republicans will be forced to keep their fucking mouths shut on the topic or face potentially losing another election.\r\n\r\nBasically:\r\nSupreme court, \"gay marriage is legal\"\r\nCongress, \"undo the supreme court's decisio-. . .
