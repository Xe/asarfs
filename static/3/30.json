Thing is, I know that people tend to haggle at garage sales: not just on big ticket items like TVs, I mean on little fifty cent rubber toys (and when they whittle it down to twenty five cents, they whip out a twenty dollar bill and it's like \"well, what was the point?\"). Thing is, I'm terrible at talking to people I don't know, much less haggling with them, and I don't want my insecurity nor my age to let people walk all over me (\"Hey, that fifty dollar TV here? Can I have it for ten?\"). My expressions show really easily on my face, though, and seasoned bargainers might take advantage of that...eep. Is it silly to be so worked up about it?\r\n\r\nOn the bright side, I can finally get rid of a ton of my stuffed animals.\r\n\r\n\"@QuasarNova\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53017c2a63687206726e0200#post_53017c2a63687206726e0200\r\n\r\nHeh.","author":"5041b54f7f123b77af00a442"},{"id":"5302efaf6368720e524b0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Personally speaking, when you want to sell something, you appeal to the neccesity/urgency of the supply and demand. You make the person interested to believe that what you are selling is what they need.\r\n\r\nAthough if I read it correctly, your problem seems something that can be fixed with some oratory or even acting classes to hide the flexes and tics that according to you, make you an easy target for buyers.

The \"Ideal\" position for both parties it would seem would be to meet half-way, but you want to bargain them to be on your side of the half-way.\r\n\r\nYou could also maybe try to price stuff to artificially inflate their bargaining price like a Silk Street Merchant. So double shit so if it comes to a 50-50 split you're at the price you wanted to sell it for originally.\r\n\r\nYou could also go through and look up some of this stuff to learn the average second-hand sale price of the item to get a better understanding of its value so you don't get ripped off. However, this in turn my waste more time than it's worth, unless you know for certain what it is you're selling before hand and you can start taking inventory and pricing stuff now. Anything collectible that you know of would be worth checking before hand, and then you can double check anything last minute or mid-sale.\r\n\r\nBut really, garage sales is where you go to buy cool cheap old shit.

That's one lost sale. Like you said, people go to garage sales for cheap old shit. But yeah, I have been looking up the prices of my stuff. Won't sell it for original price, of course, but a lot of it is valueless junk: massively printed books, stuffed animals, etc. Doesn't mean that they can't be sold, however.\r\n\r\nI went to a garage sale and bought a ten inch Christmas angel with the most unsettling goddamn face you've ever seen for a dollar.
