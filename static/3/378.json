However, although chickens have been known to develop first-generation archosaur teeth as embryos, this is caused by a lethal allele known as talpid2. Also, the teeth do not have enamel or dentin, as there are no longer any functional enamel or dentin genes in the chicken genome, only non-functional pseudogenes. This is a big hurdle, but there are two steps that could be done to overcome this:\r\n\r\n1. Either borrow enamel and dentin genes from crocodilians to replace the non-functional versions of these genes in chickens, or try to change the chicken's genes so that they are functional again.\r\n2. Try restricting talpid2 expression to the chicken embryo's jaws/mouth (the reason why talpid2 is usually lethal is because it affects organ systems and limbs).\r\n\r\nThe second one would require some good research and experimenting, though.","author":"50b70eeb7f123b1a02000097"},{"id":"5387deb76368721ed0a70200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"...If you excuse me, I'm going to start posting pics of characters I find badass, You guys can join me if you like\r\n\r\n!http://media.animevice.com/uploads/0/3503/188769-rah014.jpg!\r\n!!http://www.microforever.com/SIC/SICV04-1.jpg!!\r\n!http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9fsq3IYNE1qz7x7bo1_500.jpg!\r\n!http://www.hobbygen.com/images/ban-sic-hakbike_02.jpg!\r\nMechanical Violator Hakaider","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"5387dfb66368721fbbe00200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5387deb76368721ed0a70200#post_5387deb76368721ed0a70200\r\n\r\n> No Kenshiro\r\n> No Jotaro\r\n\r\nWut...","author":"31bee2686368722a0df23600"},{"id":"5387e0cd6368721cab470300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5387deb76368721ed0a70200#post_5387deb76368721ed0a70200\r\nok\r\n\r\n!http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/3f/Serious_Sam_3_cover.jpg!\r\n!http://www.hypemeanseverything.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/goblin.jpg!\r\n!http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2014/032/c/2/team_fortress_2__tf2____soldier_and_demoman_by_viewseps-d74m9h1.png! \r\n\r\n","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"5387e0db6368721ed0410300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Gizoid101\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5387dfb66368721fbbe00200#post_5387dfb66368721fbbe00200\r\n1: I'm not a Fist of the north star fan\r\n\r\n2: I'm not posting every character at once\r\n\r\nAlso, Jotaro goes without saying\r\n\r\n!https://i.chzbgr.com/maxW500/7857721344/h34774372/!\r\n!http://cdn.static.ovimg.com/episode/1054561.jpg!\r\nRyoma Nagare\r\n\r\n!http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20131026071926/fiction-wrestling-multiverse/images/6/60/5109.jpg!\r\n!http://drmchsr0.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/courageguy.jpg!\r\nGai Shishiou\r\n\r\n!http://31.media.tumblr.com/c1811ba5a5d06cd313fbce7a9c7df62c/tumblr_movkrdsRal1re6nxeo1_500.jpg!\r\n!http://kakeracomplex.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/gunbuster-noriko1.gif!\r\nNoriko Takaya","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"5387e11a6368721dee5f0300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!https://24.media.tumblr.com/17ce1bfabbc063f15e32fcb9290e8901/tumblr_n63q1jBbMa1qbq00vo1_250.gif! \r\n\r\nreason why spiderman was rebooted #5","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"5387e2ec6368721dd2080400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@twistedmetalero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5387e11a6368721dee5f0300#post_5387e11a6368721dee5f0300\r\n\"Where will you be when diarrhea strikes?\"","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5387e82b6368721f06fe0500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5387e2ec6368721dd2080400#post_5387e2ec6368721dd2080400\r\nAt school.","author":"50b70eeb7f123b1a02000097"},{"id":"5387f24363687243fdd60200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I feel like watching Birdemic and The Room at the same time sobber and alone.","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"5387f26063687246548e0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"For some odd reason I'm starting to like ponies and furries again. . . . . *WAIT!* Let me explain; you know that feeling of when you are with a group of people on something and you get frustrated to the point you just say, \"fuck it\" and walk off only to later on realize you didn't actually hate the thing you were with them with and just hated being around those people?  That's the feeling I'm having right now.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe breaking point for me when I was a furry was that a furry I knew was going on a tirade about \"them heteros are invading our gay fandom and taking it away from us\" and he was also ranting about how he thought all straight people, white people, christians and so forth he believed should be rounded up and shoot in the back, their children and toddlers too.\r\n\r\nThe breaking point for me being a brony while not as severe was still annoying; the brony friend I had was a outright asshole about the show.  He literally had a twilight sparkle dakimaru and was going around calling people not a \"true\" brony if twilight wasn't their \"waifu\".
