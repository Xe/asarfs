Hacking each and every individual car in a city would be near impossible because of a bunch of reason; mainly the first problem of how would you hack a moving target constantly moving out of range of signal, if you wanted to hack a individual car through say if it a gps that is far harder to do than you think cause most gps systems and such already have security against intrusions and so forth.  Also hacking individual street lights isn't as easy as watchdogs makes it out to be.\r\n\r\nMore realistically speaking if you actually wanted to carry out cyber terrorism by causing accidents you would have to mass falsify a software patch update and let me tell you something; falsifying that you're with the company that makes the software en masse on a large scale is not as easy as you think it is cause most software companies when they issue patches the certificates are not that easy to falsify.  If there was such a attack more realistically speaking it would be a extremely low level attack meant to deny service than to actually hack; basically more realistically speaking if there was such a attack it would be to prevent the cars from accessing traffic reports and such.\r\n\r\nTl:dr; Less end of the world scenario and more of someone being a dick and making you hit traffic.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"538a528863687255cb620000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"So I just saw Maleficent.\r\nThat movie had MAJOR pacing problems.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"538a5399636872524edf0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Guess who's back bitches!","author":"50c204917f123b31440000a5"},{"id":"538a53dd63687253ecfa0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Number1pegasus\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/538a5399636872524edf0000#post_538a5399636872524edf0000\r\nWADDUP BIZNATCH!","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"538a543d636872557cd10000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/538a53dd63687253ecfa0000#post_538a53dd63687253ecfa0000\r\nYO SQUIGS MY N8GA!
