The first example of this was when I was little we were all playing Jenga; someone decided to be a jackass and knock over cause he knew he was going to lose; the crazy thing about that is that it didn't fall until the dude took a second swipe so that was a good five seconds of completely ignoring gravity and even though twenty people saw it I got written off.  \"Did you guys see how that jenga tower didn't fall?\"  \"Yes; what about it?\"  \"Have you ever seen anything like that?\" \"No and that's important how?\"  \"We witnessed a violation of physics\"  \"You're crazy; we know you have mental problems so therefore you're crazy\"  \"You saw it too\".  The second example of this was a couple years back we were painting the house and one second the line masking tape was there and then gone right in front of everyone; even though everyone saw it didn't click how weird it was for something to just pop gone.\r\n\r\nIt's legitimately aggrevating cause without fail everything I always say gets written off immediately.  It's one of the questions I ask myself on a regular basis; I know I have severe problems, but why the fuck did everyone else see those incidents too and why did they instantely write it off as \"oh uc9's being crazy again\" if they saw it as well?  Totally going into tinfoil hat mode, but it's almost as if people are programmed to ignore anything and everything weird even if large numbers of people all saw the same thing.  Hypothetically you could have the mythological lock ness monster having a tea party with mythological big foot and the second the person witnessing it looks away they would instantly forget it or ignore it pretending it didn't happen.  Am I crazy?  Am I not crazy?\r\n\r\nYou can see how aggrevating it must be.[/spoiler]","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54c1f5006368724e7ee93a00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54c1f3a16368722f22af1b00#post_54c1f3a16368722f22af1b00\r\nDude man.
