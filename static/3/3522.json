What I mean by this is look at Naruto; it at first used to be good, but they didn't stop even when anyone with a brain would have told you to stop.  Which would you rather have a series that ends still good or a series that continues to go on and on for the sake of appeasing the fans.  Sure there are tv shows, movie series, books and such that continue for decades but they are not the norm by any stretch of the imagination.\r\n\r\nPersonally, just blowing shit out my ass at this point, but I think six episodes for a short anime is the magic number; the reason being is that six episodes gives you the perfect amount of episodes without having to resort to any filler; 12 episodes is good, but chances are there's going to be some filler; 24 episodes chances are a fair bit of the episodes are solely going to be filler.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54c1c826636872209c442900","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@EHAN\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54c1c71b63687224e23e1200#post_54c1c71b63687224e23e1200\r\n\"@Number1pegasus\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54c1c7986368726eeca74700#post_54c1c7986368726eeca74700\r\nIt's kind of like the opposite of what happened witb NGE.\r\nI didn't care about the dumb Angel bullshit, but I DID care about Shinji.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54c1c83963687216a9582b00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54c1c7696368721c72b01b00#post_54c1c7696368721c72b01b00\r\n!http://24.media.tumblr.com/abf2bd2453f010c0fd50b058201c3741/tumblr_mive5vsbv21rz41r8o1_500.png!\r\n\r\n*Trashboat then preceded to jump out the window*","author":"500757fd7f123b75a90003b1"},{"id":"54c1c842636872702a601800","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54c1c7696368721c72b01b00#post_54c1c7696368721c72b01b00\r\nIf you won't watch it, then can you at least acknowledge its historical significance?
