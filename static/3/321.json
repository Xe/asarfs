It does that too. It still causes more environmental harm in the way I describe.\r\nCome back later.[/bq]\r\nActually algae oil is good cause it takes out far more carbon than it puts out.  It takes out double the amount of carbon it puts into the atmosphere.

You could have plants to grow the algae in the city and do all the stuff to turn it into oil in the city.  You wouldn't need to transport it thousands of miles; you could just do it right there.\r\n\r\nThe problem with it, like I said, is that the process to crack open the cell walls is expensive.  Once they figure out how to do that cheaply the oil industry is going to be a dead parrot in that it will be no more, it will have ceased to be, it will have ceased to be alive.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"537d77cf6368723cc7190000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/537d76c9636872395a090000#post_537d76c9636872395a090000\r\nI read that they can get 5,000 gallons of fuel _per week_ per acre, as opposed to 150 gallons _per year_ per acre from corn.","author":"5010fa077f123b1e4f00104e"},{"id":"537d78216368723c0a300000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@someguy111\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/537d77cf6368723cc7190000#post_537d77cf6368723cc7190000\r\nThat's cause you don't need farmland.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"537d78e7636872395ab30000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"You won't believe how versatile the \"Hemp\":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemp plants are.

Also algae overs pretty much the entire acre too, instead of corn crops which have quite a large gap between each plant leaving much of the land unused. Algae is a much better use of space.","author":"5010fa077f123b1e4f00104e"},{"id":"537d79536368723b14a80000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Is marijuana legal in some states in the US?","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"537d79ba6368723a38c10000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SeraphimDawn\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/537d79536368723b14a80000#post_537d79536368723b14a80000\r\nColorado.","author":"50b70eeb7f123b1a02000097"},{"id":"537d79cb6368723b4ed10000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://i522.photobucket.com/albums/w341/DragonboyGT/1400542319685_zpsf8690fa6.gif?t=1400556434!","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"537d7a226368723d0c4e0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SeraphimDawn\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/537d78e7636872395ab30000#post_537d78e7636872395ab30000\r\nFun fact: the US government banned the growing of hemp but all of a sudden _required_ farmers to grow it on their land because it was used to make textiles for the war. After the war the farmers were forced to rid the crop from their land or face severe punishment. So basically \"hemp is horrible, it has use no and no purpose other than the devil's weed.
