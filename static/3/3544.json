Hold on folks, before the shitstorm starts let me just explain why they're reviewing it; the reason why they're reviewing the death sentence is because turns out the last bunch of death sentences they've been utterly fucking it up.  When you hear \"lethal injection\" you would imagine them putting the prisoner under and injecting a lethal dosage of say tranquilizers or such; straight up nah, they've been injecting non-medically approved concoctions to the point prisoners are screaming and yelling and thrashing about their bodies feeling as though they're being burned alive.\r\n\r\nPersonally I think it does need to be reviewed cause it's straight up illegal to have non-medical professionals in charge and carrying out medical procedures.[/bq]\r\n\r\nAnd they have been doing this since... How many years?[/bq]\r\nAnd you wonder why the supreme court is reviewing it?","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54c31f71636872170e3e0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54c31f226368724d60f30000#post_54c31f226368724d60f30000\r\n\r\nI wonder more how long this has been a thing.","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"54c31f9463687223bccb0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!https://40.media.tumblr.com/716c826b7c355c984df24c92fb4f07a7/tumblr_n41tqlMqA21r3opnco1_400.jpg!\r\n!https://41.media.tumblr.com/5b3228c5a9b3cf050fa23acc9cec9679/tumblr_n41tqlMqA21r3opnco2_400.jpg!\r\n\r\nam i the only one amused by the fact riff raff adds versace to random words ","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"54c32015636872102f1c0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@QuasarNova\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54c31f71636872170e3e0100#post_54c31f71636872170e3e0100\r\nQuite a while, cause if you are a doctor and you perform a lethal injection for the state you lose your license.  There might be a possibility that the death sentence in the usa might get the axe because in order for the death sentence to be legal it has to be a lethal injection from a doctor, but if you're a doctor you'll lose your license and they've been trying to fly under the supreme court's radar for this.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54c320a36368724037ad0500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://40.media.tumblr.com/fa4b08acaf4dee69a2ecf9599f5828ff/tumblr_nf4aasLaTz1u0b4c7o1_1280.png!\r\n!http://41.media.tumblr.com/22657be2461d6996748206e46337dfa4/tumblr_nf4aasLaTz1u0b4c7o2_1280.png!\r\n!http://40.media.tumblr.com/c3affe3dd1d4e0e5fe792fb0a12324c3/tumblr_nf4aasLaTz1u0b4c7o3_1280.png!\r\n!http://36.media.tumblr.com/c5aa533cbdd846822e6c9cf19855c447/tumblr_nf4aasLaTz1u0b4c7o4_1280.png!\r\n!http://40.media.tumblr.com/d1c98281d6904b883c8aeeb9dafdc88b/tumblr_nf4aasLaTz1u0b4c7o5_1280.png!","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"54c320dc63687267f9eb0600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54c320a36368724037ad0500#post_54c320a36368724037ad0500\r\nRollout.","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"54c321106368721f4fe01d00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Carcass Strife\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54c320dc63687267f9eb0600#post_54c320dc63687267f9eb0600\r\n!https://36.media.tumblr.com/4dbb20ea15be8c4bfa21ef08b5d88f26/tumblr_n3dg78uPHf1rp8ge9o1_500.png!","author":"505696b47f123b37e800effa"},{"id":"54c3214b6368721f4ff51d00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@igotnopicks\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54c321106368721f4fe01d00#post_54c321106368721f4fe01d00\r\nEmerald was probably my favorite TPP run","author":"9ba2e84e636164642cc03200"},{"id":"54c3214f636872170edf0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@igotnopicks\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54c321106368721f4fe01d00#post_54c321106368721f4fe01d00\r\n....\r\nDidn't see that coming, at all xD","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"54c3220663687223bcaa0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Carcass Strife\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54c3214f636872170edf0100#post_54c3214f636872170edf0100\r\n!http://www.skepdick.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/spanish-inquisition.jpg!\r\n\r\n\r\n\"@EHAN\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54c3214b6368721f4ff51d00#post_54c3214b6368721f4ff51d00\r\nMy favorite run of Twitch Plays Pokemon is well Black 1.","author":"505696b47f123b37e800effa"},{"id":"54c323e763687223bc5e0300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@igotnopicks\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54c321106368721f4fe01d00#post_54c321106368721f4fe01d00\r\nM4 was the best to come out of Twitch.","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"54c325336368725e83010100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"just for context These were taken from google streetview\r\n!http://cdn3.whatculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/10-Google-Earth.jpg!\r\n!http://cdn3.whatculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/13-Google-Earth.jpg!\r\nThe first is from France and the second is from Japan.","author":"4fc958fc945b703fa301f910"},{"id":"54c325536368724894920500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!https://40.media.tumblr.com/50869a791b5965ae9c16e1df8a40eeed/tumblr_n2hxzlpYSe1qky1tlo1_1280.jpg!\r\nHe's right though.
