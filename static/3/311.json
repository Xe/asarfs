The reason being is that for the past I think decade when it came to computer generated graphics in movies and games the way animation has been taken care of is to give character models really high pixel count, but pay no heed to actual animation thus resulting in unnatural movement of characters.\r\n\r\nI think that's why I like RWBY is that is proves that you don't have to have a million dollar budget; instead just make the characters move naturally and fluidly.  If you look at RWBY the actual character models aren't all that great to the point a first semester student could probably do better, but that doesn't detract away from it cause the characters have plenty of energy and look like they're actually moving instead of how many shows the characters just look like a creepy puppet that someone is pulling the strings on to move.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"537b8b3563687202f3500400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/537b8adb63687201b4f20300#post_537b8adb63687201b4f20300\r\nYup.\r\nSo you've seen Gowther.

Someone somewhere actually thought mandatory DLC with entire chapters of video games was a good idea.  Someone somewhere thought first day DLC was a good idea.  Why do individuals think this?  Cause the logical fallacy that more expensive products will have more consumers.  When in fact the reverse is true; the immediate problem with this is Unity.  It's a freemium game engine(the windows and mac version is free; the pro version $1500 though) and it's one of the hottest things right now in video gaming.\r\n\r\nAnother example of what I mean by this is Adobe is a big company I'll give them that, but they're only worth $18 billion but that's cause they have a total of fifty products.  I'm not saying that Adobe will ever go bankrupt or such; rather when you get right down to it the reason why they have the cloud service instead now is that they ran out of ways to milk photoshop and so forth for money.\r\n\r\nThe immediate problem with any software is that eventually you're going to run out of ways to make it better to give it a \"NEW RELEASE VERSION! BUY NOW!(TM)\" which has the long term financial problem of once you reach the point at which any new products doesn't have any new features to it what is the point in charging full price for new products?\r\n\r\nWhat is realistically the most likely scenario in the long run is a lot of companies are going to fuck themselves and screw themselves over.  Basically what Unity is doing to the video game industry; the other engines wanted to be dicks and wound up only fucking themselves in the end.  Obviously they're still around and such, but a couple years from now if a company wants to develop games and asks to buy a company license to use a engine if a company that develops game engines says, \"That'll be 100k\" they'll get laughed right out of the building.  It'll probably be the same with a lot of software and hardware in general to where you'll get laughed out the building.\r\n\r\nIt's probably going to be the same for home computers as well.  I don't mean that as a \"Tablets are teh next big thing\" way; rather what is probably going to wind up happening in the long run is computers are going to get cheaper and smaller.  In ten years time charging $500(inflation adjusted) for a home computer?  You'll get laughed at.\r\n\r\nIt's probably going to be the same for a lot of websites too; we already have a lot of websites that are functionally the same as deviantart, tumblr and so forth.  The same thing will probably happen to youtube; costs will get driven down to the point there's dozens of clone sites that are functionally the same.\r\n\r\n\r\nTl:dr; People like cheap products and if you keep charging the same high price you run the risk of competitors underselling you.  The companies currently charging outrageous amounts of money for products will probably wind up fucking themselves in the long run when people undersell them.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"537ba94963687252fb110300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/537ba88f636872589b630200#post_537ba88f636872589b630200\r\nWell yeah that's capitalism at it's most basic idea.\r\nIf you want to attract customers, make a better product than your competitors.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"}]}
