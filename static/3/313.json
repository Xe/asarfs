I don't know much about Hilary's stance on things like legalizing cannabis or giving the American people the other personal freedoms they have been stripped of back.

It's a far safer bet when the usa is three steps away from a police state to bet on that person when they have to work more towards that end than the person who wants to close that one last final gap towards a theocracy.  Considering the backlash against the nsa and such if someone wants to strip away that final straw they're going to have to seriously work for it; if someone wants the usa as a theocracy they could just go (click) done.

Scientology not only actively discourages anyone from looking too closely but exploits its status as an outsider to defend itself from persecution for the many, many, many good reasons to persecute them.\r\n\r\nPut simply christianity is too big to really pull this sort of stuff off, its too much of an exposed target.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, people like that judge who claimed that only Christians should be allowed Freedom of Speech need watching, but the odds of them being able to bring these twisted ideas into effect on anything more than a local level, and even then only so long as it takes for the issue to reach the supreme court, are so low that you could *almost* dismiss them out of hand.\r\n\r\nLike I said, such people need to be watched for as long as they keep themselves in the public eye, but the way I see it their lunacy is more the deranged ramblings of dying perspectives. The more the world moves past their backwards ideas, the louder they scream in a desperate attempt to keep their petty tatters of control.","author":"4f41ee04945b701c41002af7"},{"id":"537bfc5f63687261f9fc0400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"MORE TIME WASTING!\r\n!http://i.imgur.com/yzRWgCe.jpg!","author":"4fe16df67f123b13e400003f"},{"id":"537bfcf46368726187480500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@gasmaskangel\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/537bfb20636872660c100500#post_537bfb20636872660c100500\r\n_Donâ€™t get me wrong, people like that judge who claimed that only Christians should be allowed Freedom of Speech need watching_\r\n\r\nI don't get it, how can someone like that even be elected as a judge in the first place?
