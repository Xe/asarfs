Princess Tutu's story is about the power and wonder of stories. It has it's comedic moments but it never loses site of itself. The characters are all interesting in how they fit and break away from their narrative archetypes. The animation is GORGEOUS and the dancing scenes are just a wonder to behold. It's a full fledged story, that's fun, heart-warming, and even a little sad at times.\r\n","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54d0600a636872067b050200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54d05fb763687204c0550200#post_54d05fb763687204c0550200\r\nAlright, I'll check it out and see what I think.","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"54d06026636872019af00000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Since we're talking about favorite things\r\n\r\nWhat was your favorite childhood beverage?
