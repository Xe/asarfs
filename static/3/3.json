I'm a S-Rank all day sucker for supernatural tv shows(including supernatural) and a double sucker for shows with youkai and supernatural \"monsters\" in them.  Personally I like how they're developing the hunter arcs into their own ovas not dependent on the series.  Like the one about the necromancer wanting to \"protect\" her zombie friend is technically a part of the first series, but fits with either one.   I don't know if they'll continue the show or not, but they haven't gotten past the current story arc so I'll be a while until they get back on track.  Basically main show is on hiatus and making the current arcs into ovas, cause they're making they're not done with the story yet in the manga.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"52d365d5636872199d600300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/52d3652063687219e3460300#post_52d3652063687219e3460300\r\n\r\nFor those that thought Hanna-Barbera's animation was bad... here's a testament that there's always some who does it better, well in this case, worse than you could ever hope.\r\n\r\n","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"52d365f16368726d14360000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/52d365c46368726a79260000#post_52d365c46368726a79260000\r\nI recently discovered Seinfield is funny.","author":"4fddff15945b706cf6000520"},{"id":"52d366396368721a93e20300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@QuasarNova\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/52d365d5636872199d600300#post_52d365d5636872199d600300\r\nThe only good thing that Studio knack has made is the Anime adaptation of the Little prince","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"52d3664e6368726347cf0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110123203837/glee/images/8/88/Weird.gif!","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"52d3666a6368720a95160000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/52d365c46368726a79260000#post_52d365c46368726a79260000\r\n\r\nSherlock\r\n\r\n\r\n\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/52d366396368721a93e20300#post_52d366396368721a93e20300\r\n\r\nYou think that redeems them?","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"}]}
