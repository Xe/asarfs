Which means I'll have to use my school's computers if I want to talk to you guys or do my online homework. It's only temporary, but hopefully things will work out and I find myself back at full operation.\r\n\r\n*Good news:* I've been watching more episodes of Attack on Titan, and I am now on Episode 5. I have to admit, it's a pretty dang good show. I'm a little worried to get too attached to anyone, because I'm sure a lot of them are going to die, and I might really get pissed off if their deaths are really tragic or stupid. However, some of the people I like the most are the main three, and others, like Jean, Annie, and Sasha. Especially Sasha. (I SWEAR IF SHE DIES I'M GOING TO BE SO FREAKING MAD) and I'm still interested in what's going to happen next. But what I've seen so far, it's pretty awesome. Also, I cannot get enough of the really good animation, action, and music. ESPECIALLY THE MUSIC.\r\n\r\nI wish I could talk more about stuff, but I'm pretty much handicapped at this point, so wish me luck, and I hope I can fix this mess while keeping up with school.\r\n-I swear bullcrap like this always happens every time my dad leaves home to go travel for work-","author":"536f7a11636872666e2d0000"},{"id":"54be98c3636872742aa51700","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Shadow the Hedgehog\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54be97606368724d13700300#post_54be97606368724d13700300\r\nSpeaking of TF2, you watch NISLT?","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"54be98db6368726815ef2900","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Shadow the Hedgehog\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54be92c963687244021e4d00#post_54be92c963687244021e4d00\r\n!https://toxicmuffin.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/doki-nichijou-04-1280x720-h264-aac-1686eced-mkv_snapshot_10-05_2011-09-29_22-08-51.jpg!","author":"9ba2e84e636164642cc03200"},{"id":"54be98ee6368727d15e40000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@ToskiHero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54be98c36368726815d72900#post_54be98c36368726815d72900\r\nDon't you have an iPhone or something?","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"54be990e63687205512d0700","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Carcass Strife\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54be959e6368721e0f240700#post_54be959e6368721e0f240700\r\nIt's better than Batman's parents.","author":"505696b47f123b37e800effa"}]}
