Christ; they had interesting character development and then they pulled a bait and switch just to not make anyone angry that they killed off a character by retconning her as alive later.  I know it's a spoiler, but chances are nobody else watches it; one of the main characters dies, but nope turns out she's magically fine the next episode.\r\n\r\nI have a feeling this is going to turn out why Dog Days is such garbage cause chances are it'll be a war anime where nobody gets injured.  The previous girls that were originally main characters have already been sidelined so chances are that girl will get immediately sidelined.\r\n\r\nKantai; please stop cycling through your \"main\" characters every episode cause if you have each character have a episode where they're considered a main character then how is anyone supposed to develop any attachment to them.\r\n\r\nThe girl showed up for less than ten minutes, \"died\" then somehow came back.
