Basically otakus in Japan are tired of large scale companies threatening to pull advertising dollars if they receive bad press and that they constantly are forced to push positive press meaning those that have more money get more positive attention and such.\r\n\r\nIt's more like the dorito pope thing than what's currently going on cause the manga industry isn't yelling at anyone for being criticisized, they're not yelling racial slurs at those criticisizing them or anything; they're just a bunch of sell outs and they are addressing the concerns of people.\r\n\r\nMangagate summarized in one image:\r\n!http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/757/263/193.jpg!\r\n\r\nAnyways the reason why most of everyone here hasn't heard of it is that it's been really civil.  Also the reason why I bring this up is that looking at mangagate I *HIGHLY* have to doubt any shonen manga or anime(yes I know shonen is a demographic before you get your panties in a bunch) is going to fill the void left by Naruto because the changes going on right now behind the scenes will make it impossible for something like Naruto to happen again; the reason being is that Naruto, DBZ and such became popular through unethical business practices and now the manga and anime industry is changing business practice wise cause of the concerns of watchers so the way those franchises became popular are completely shut out for new series now.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54a8923b6368727e4ab90100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@AppleJackFrost\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a891736368727ab5490700#post_54a891736368727ab5490700\r\n\"This channel\":https://www.youtube.com/user/reddevils500b","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"54a8926b63687235ad8e0800","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a89200636872762a3f0700#post_54a89200636872762a3f0700\r\nI see","author":"4fdef063945b700a9d01604f"},{"id":"54a8930063687238cd570600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a892276368727049ea0100#post_54a892276368727049ea0100\r\nIf we're talking about in Japan, Dragonball became popular because there was nothing else quite like it at the time.  (No Idea how Z exploded in popularity in america though.)\r\n\r\nAlso, Hokuto no Ken was nothing like Dragon Ball. (At least the early stuff)\r\n\r\nEdit: I do admit that if it wasn't for the Dr. Slump crossover, People probably woudn't have even noticed it.
