UGGGGGGGHHHHHHH. . . .\r\n\r\nI'm getting more and more annoyed lately and nobody seems to want to fuck off and leave me alone.\r\n\r\nTo make it succinct basically my family won't feck off and leave me alone for two seconds.  I'll admit I'm in the wrong here cause I don't want to spend time with people, but it's not cause I'm being anti-social but rather I don't feel anything from family bonding.  Basically despite how I act to be emotional and such I rarely and never to nearly as much as other people feel emotions.  I pretend to be emotional because that's how I interact with people, but to use an analogy think of human emotions as like a filled cup; hyper-emotion people are like a overfilled cup, emotionally cold people are like a cup that's half empty; I'm more along the lines of a cup that only the bare bottom part has anything in it.  If I weren't constantly forced to act \"HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY(tm)\" I would act drastically different.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reason why I'm annoyed is that I can't act honestly cause the first assumption everyone makes is that something must be wrong.\r\n\"What's wrong?\"\r\n\"Nothing\"\r\n\"Something must be wrong if you don't want to hang out; what's wrong?\"\r\n\"Nothing\"\r\n\"You're not acting happy; what's wrong?\"\r\n\"Nothing\"\r\n\"What's wrong?\"\r\n\"Nothing\"\r\n\r\nNot being happy doesn't automatically mean being depressed.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54b9b86c6368724cc5e90600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Number1pegasus\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54b9b83a6368726d3def0300#post_54b9b83a6368726d3def0300\r\nYou'd be surprised how many scenes ae ad-libbed during filming.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54b9b88e6368725845d10600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54b9b7e06368725870010800#post_54b9b7e06368725870010800\r\nWE ARE ONE, WE ARE THE SAME","author":"50c204917f123b31440000a5"},{"id":"54b9b8c86368724d364c0800","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54b9b8546368725233040b00#post_54b9b8546368725233040b00\r\nTHIS.\r\nI KNOW THIS FEEL.","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"54b9b8d26368722437910300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54b9b7e06368725870010800#post_54b9b7e06368725870010800\r\n\"@Number1pegasus\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54b9b83a6368726d3def0300#post_54b9b83a6368726d3def0300\r\nBROTHERS!","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54b9b8e763687259eb800900","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@ToskiHero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54b9b4d66368724530ca0400#post_54b9b4d66368724530ca0400\r\nYou live in a rural area?","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"54b9b915636872660a870200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54b9b8d26368722437910300#post_54b9b8d26368722437910300\r\n\"@Number1pegasus\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54b9b88e6368725845d10600#post_54b9b88e6368725845d10600\r\n*JOIN THE FOLD....!*","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"54b9b92663687258d4900600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54b9b8546368725233040b00#post_54b9b8546368725233040b00\r\nI don't mean to sound like a jerk.\r\nBut they're your family man.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54b9b98f6368725aae080b00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54b9b8546368725233040b00#post_54b9b8546368725233040b00\r\nI getcha.
