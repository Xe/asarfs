Well after Naruto's ended ecchi and hentai seems to be making a bounce back.  Obviously Boku no hero academia is popular, but it's no Naruto popularity wise and if you ask your average street goer what they know about hero academia they won't know what the hell you're talking about.  What I mean by this is that Naruto's over, Bleach has lost most of it's popularity, dragonball *as a tv show* is over and such there's nothing to fill the gap so theoretically everything is going back to how it was before those franchises came about with hentai and ecchi being king.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54a887766368727a14700100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I tried it, even though apparently my computer automatically defragments itself every week or so.
