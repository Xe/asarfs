Even to those who don't like the show, I thank you for being tolerant enough to not haze me for liking it.\r\n\r\nAttack on Titan hasn't become my favorite show of all time, but it's definitely one of the most impressive-looking anime I've seen in a long while. It's not perfect, and it's pretty harsh and dark, but my god does it feel so epic to sit back and watch it for its majesty. Then again, this is me talking about Attack on Titan.\r\n \r\n*As for a certain surprise after the credits:*\r\n[spoiler]!http://images.latintimes.com/sites/latintimes.com/files/styles/large/public/2014/07/11/attack-titan-season-2.jpg?itok=M2rqIj4m!\r\n[/spoiler]\r\n*~[spoiler]That won't end well for sure...\r\nNothing can end well from a scenario like that.[/spoiler]~*\r\n","author":"536f7a11636872666e2d0000"},{"id":"54c5e45a636872663b010400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"edit","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"54c5e45a6368725f44e20500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@ToskiHero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54c5e43a6368726cdaf10600#post_54c5e43a6368726cdaf10600\r\nThe thing doesn't look amused.","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"54c5e4646368725fb3540600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I'm going to bed.\r\n\r\nGood night all\r\nAnyways it's Sunday where I'm at but,\r\n!http://cosmic-fitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/monday.jpg!","author":"505696b47f123b37e800effa"},{"id":"54c5e47b6368726cda070700","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@igotnopicks\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54c5e4646368725fb3540600#post_54c5e4646368725fb3540600\r\nnight","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"54c5e47f63687215a0160300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@igotnopicks\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54c5e4646368725fb3540600#post_54c5e4646368725fb3540600\r\nFuck Mondays!","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"54c5e4b76368726a96730500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54c5e423636872614fb30700#post_54c5e423636872614fb30700\r\n\r\n[spoiler]how big is your real boner?[/spoiler]","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"54c5e4b86368720505650100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@ToskiHero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54c5e43a6368726cdaf10600#post_54c5e43a6368726cdaf10600\r\nAnd I admit that for all of my dislike of AOT, There's nothing else I've ever seen that can instill such a Feeling of Horrific Wonder.","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"54c5e51e6368724896760100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54c5e4b76368726a96730500#post_54c5e4b76368726a96730500\r\nAbout five inches.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54c5e5206368726cda490700","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@ToskiHero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54c5e43a6368726cdaf10600#post_54c5e43a6368726cdaf10600\r\ncongration","author":"9ba2e84e636164642cc03200"},{"id":"54c5e56e636872057ec20200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54c5e51e6368724896760100#post_54c5e51e6368724896760100\r\n[spoiler]oh good, i might be able to take it all without gagging\r\ni'll certainly try[/spoiler]","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"54c5e57b6368727cb3640100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@ToskiHero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54c5e43a6368726cdaf10600#post_54c5e43a6368726cdaf10600\r\nAttack on Titan is adapted from a manga, so if you're feeling particularly impatient, you can find it somewhere on the internet and continue the story.","author":"5043cdb47f123b72cc0032d3"},{"id":"54c5e6da6368726868070700","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Silent_Witness\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54c5e57b6368727cb3640100#post_54c5e57b6368727cb3640100\r\nI did say I was going to avoid future spoilers from the manga until Attack on Titan's Season 2 starts to air, so don't expect me to follow it all that much.\r\n\r\nBecause I want to be surprised.\r\nEven if I might come off as being silly or stupid being surprised.","author":"536f7a11636872666e2d0000"},{"id":"54c5e6dc63687268680b0700","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"[spoiler]Fresh precure's theme might be the worst Anime opening I've ever heard in my life.[/spoiler]\r\n\r\nAlso, I see AOT as a nearly Unmatched Spectacle.
