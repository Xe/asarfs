There are people like where my family is from and even people over here in the states that can handle alcohol just fine but because they are under some arbitrary age the government just made up one day all of a sudden they can't handle it because the government said so. There are people who _are_ legally allowed to drink and still can't handle it but that's fine simply because the government said they can because they have reached that arbitrary age. Also on the subject of of alcohol, why do some states have limits one the ABV of beers and other drinks and limit the size of the containers they can be sold in? Do you really think someone from the State or Utah is physically and mentally different than someone from the next state over? Of course they are! The government said so. When you enter that state of Utah you suddenly can't handle any beer over just a few percent crossing the border causes an immediate change in your psychical and mental abilities.","author":"5010fa077f123b1e4f00104e"},{"id":"537c18e16368724b2c380100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@someguy111\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/537c17b563687247afea0000#post_537c17b563687247afea0000\r\nSomething like this sounds good.\r\n\r\nRatings for movies and games should also be a combination of age and mental maturity level, though I'd have no idea how to measure the latter.","author":"50b70eeb7f123b1a02000097"},{"id":"537c191c636872464c4e0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Randomosaur\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/537c18e16368724b2c380100#post_537c18e16368724b2c380100\r\nFinally, Something We actually agree on","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"537c19ae6368724c747e0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Randomosaur\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/537c18e16368724b2c380100#post_537c18e16368724b2c380100\r\nTesting of course.
