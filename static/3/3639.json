I forced myself to finish Sticker Star to see if it got better, but it only got worse and worse.\r\n\r\nFighting enemies is a waste of time and should only ever be done so you can learn the timing of action commands, the story is barely there, there are no partners, the closest thing to a partner in the game has absolutly useless hints when you ask her to give you one, the puzzles require thing stickers that are a absolute pain to solve, especially if you had the thing sticker needed for it earlier but used it in a battle because there is no way for you to know you need that thing unless you use a guide or have played through before, bosses can be very hard if you cannot figure out what thing stickers you need to use on them to make them weaker, some of these thing are found in the same level as the boss and you will have to backtrack to town to turn it into a thing sticker then run back to the level you were in, the final boss needs SEVERAL THING STICKERS to even make the fight manageable which again you had no way of knowing unless you were using a guide, but all of that piles up onto the biggest problem with the game. Thanks to how you have to use stickers to do anything in this game, and since its better to ignore enemies, the game usually ends up being *INVENTORY MANAGEMENT: THE GAME* since you have to do so much of it!\r\n\r\nIf I didn't buy FE:A, I'm fairly sure I would have given up on Intelligent Systems alltogether after that.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, this took forever to type.","author":"4fde01d7945b70057c00024d"},{"id":"54c832b663687236a4e40600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Carcass Strife\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54c8328c6368723276f00800#post_54c8328c6368723276f00800\r\nMost people on 4chan are anons yes.","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"54c832b763687237cbe60700","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54c83253636872036a630a00#post_54c83253636872036a630a00\r\n\r\n\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54c8325a6368726df8d40000#post_54c8325a6368726df8d40000\r\nOH SHIT!
