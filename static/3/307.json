One thing I will say for ancient tech is that it seems to be made very well; CPU's from over a decode ago work fine and CPU's made today seem to drop like flies. It's not just the CPU's either, it seems most everything in a consumer-grade PC nowadays breaks easily. When I build my next system I think I'm going to use server/workstation parts, they are built for pros and are made to be reliable and used very hard constantly.","author":"5010fa077f123b1e4f00104e"},{"id":"537a973e63687261d9670700","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@twistedmetalero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/537a971163687213725a0500#post_537a971163687213725a0500\r\nMade a good frisbee.","author":"5010fa077f123b1e4f00104e"},{"id":"537a975d6368726811330200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@someguy111\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/537a97196368723d53a00000#post_537a97196368723d53a00000\r\nNot only the processor in fact, but very single piece of that comp is still working.","author":"509129db7f123b36cb010fa5"},{"id":"537a98466368721d2bfa0500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@boz\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/537a975d6368726811330200#post_537a975d6368726811330200\r\nSame with the laptop which is 15 years old I think.

They are about the same price and they are basically the same CPU but the Xeon is better in that it's made better and has ECC and a few pro features enables that make it chew through things like rendering and photoshop.
