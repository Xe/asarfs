Though, I don't really believe in the word \"normal\".\r\n\r\nThough, you should speak up about this and tell them to stop. Or you do what I do when someone does something I don't like. I beat them by making them contradict themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[WARNING: This is me ranting about my childhood below]\r\n[spoiler]My childhood wasn't as bad as yours (wow that made me sound jerkish) but I did have some rough times. I was bullied from the start of my elementary school till middle school. They called me names, took my stuff and humiliated me everyday. When I got into middle school, I thought my life was about to change. But instead, I got the same bullshit that I lived through as well.\r\nI became secluded and usually avoid large crowds. These people would waste their time to mock me and throughout my life, I wonder \"why?\". Despite their jerkish attitudes, I myself am to be blamed. I was always a bit \"too nice\" during those years and instead of fighting back, I would do what they say despite not liking it.\r\n\r\nOne day, I got tired of this guy and his pals for treating me like shit that I got up from my chair, poured water from my bottle on him when he was lying on a bunch of chair and when he got up, I punched him while using my watch as a knuckle.\r\n\r\nHe immediately squealed back and was terrified. There was some blood too. I was just so angry at him that I acted without thinking. When I looked at my hands, I fell on my knees and cried. I was suspended from school for a week and the news crew knew nothing of it (thank god!). My dad knew of my bullying problem and even consulted the principle but that bastard did nothing. When he heard I got suspended for brawling, he didn't scold me. He just didn't talk... My mom scolded me but I kinda deserved it.\r\n\r\nGoing back to that school felt different. I never saw that kid again and I heard he transferred to a different school. It felt weird... His pals didn't bother me anymore. In fact, no one bothered me anymore. My friends were my friends and my enemies are gone. It was smooth sailing but it felt horrible.[/spoiler]","author":"4fe1b9f47f123b13df002976"},{"id":"54c2101b636872464e4d1c00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Number1pegasus\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54c20f2463687218a3740b00#post_54c20f2463687218a3740b00\r\nNah \r\nI just got muh \"babybackbabybackbabybackbabyback ribs\":http://youtu.be/8GdzbCIxkzo","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"54c210616368724709b21100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"It's also kind of funny how in MGS4 Snake need a goddamn RAILGUN to beat a bunch of Irvings whereas Raiden does the same thing with a fucking sword.\r\nAnd another thought, if the B&B Corps had to fight Revengeance Raiden, how long do you think they'd last before getting zandatsu'd to fuck?","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54c21114636872048ecc2b00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://i522.photobucket.com/albums/w341/DragonboyGT/Lance1_zps385cdb48.png!\r\n!http://i522.photobucket.com/albums/w341/DragonboyGT/Lance2_zps06f913f4.png!\r\n!http://i522.photobucket.com/albums/w341/DragonboyGT/Lance3_zps48929f1a.png!","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"54c21190636872202f542e00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54c210616368724709b21100#post_54c210616368724709b21100\r\nNot nearly as long as the bosses in revengeance","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"54c211f363687279792b1200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54c210616368724709b21100#post_54c210616368724709b21100\r\n\r\n\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54c21190636872202f542e00#post_54c21190636872202f542e00\r\nThey are literally already dead!\r\n\r\n","author":"50c204917f123b31440000a5"},{"id":"54c212966368720400db0900","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@HJSDGCE\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54c20fc763687216a8243900#post_54c20fc763687216a8243900\r\nIf you ever wonder why the usa is so shitty when it comes to helping people with mental problems after experiencing it firsthand our entire mental health care system summarized in a nutshell is \"you're crazy; stop being crazy!

Just cause someone thinks differently doesn't automatically mean insane or depressed; by this logic anyone from any other culture or such is automatically insane cause they act differently from how you act.\r\n\r\nI'll be the first to admit that I don't get why people have such strange thoughts as \"what if <x> rejects me?\" or \"what if <x> says my hair looks funny?\" or numerous other common thoughts, but does that make me crazy for thinking differently?  Nah; chances are my shrink was just shoving me out the door and trying to get me anti-depressants cause she didn't want to deal with my shit when I just have a tendency to seriously stress out about finances.  Sure I understand other people but I just don't get them, but that doesn't make me crazy.  Personally I think it's weird for people to have things like desires, hopes or work themselves to death for some trophy or such but does that mean I don't understand it?  No; I understand desire; I just don't get it and think it's weird.\r\n\r\nTo me it's weird that people like everyone else on the thread stress themselves out over say whether or not <x> person likes you, but does that mean you're crazy?  No.  Does that make me crazy for not thinking like that?  No.\r\n\r\n\r\n:\\\r\nI think the problem is that I was instantly wrote off as insane regardless of how much I bettered myself even after I overcame a lot of my past problems.  Sure I stress about money often, but that sure as hell doesn't mean I hurt myself cause of it.  Honestly that's a load off my mind cause if you're constantly told \"you're crazy cause you think differently\" and then realize that person is full of shit and just trying to push meds on you that's a massive weight lifted.  I actually feel kind of better cause I don't know how many times I've been instantly written off cause \"you're crazy; here's anti-depressants\".  You know a psychologist is shit-tier if you feel better away from them than going to their meetings.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54c235a46368725238522300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54c22c006368722d09cc0600#post_54c22c006368722d09cc0600\r\nYour shrink had a job to help you unstress but instead gave you pills.\r\nDamn, whoever that is, she is not doing a good job.","author":"4fe1b9f47f123b13df002976"},{"id":"54c23a50636872687d1f0800","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54c22c006368722d09cc0600#post_54c22c006368722d09cc0600\r\n\r\n\"@HJSDGCE\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54c235a46368725238522300#post_54c235a46368725238522300\r\nAnd Americans call us Asians strange.
