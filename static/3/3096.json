Call me crazy but I did like how he was portrayed in the 2000 movie with his mentality of \"the leaders of the world will know of our struggle when they are bretheren\".  I didn't like how he went through with it anyhow after learning of senator Kelley's death; personally I would have liked the ending better if he learned about the senator's death after the machine had already started and it couldn't be stopped and him helping stop it before killing the leaders, but that's just me.\r\n\r\nWhen he's a anti-hero is when he's best.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54ac9e4f6368721f38e60500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I think I might go bother my granddad in the morning.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"}]}
