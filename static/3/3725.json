And it was a lucid dream.\r\n\r\nAt first, I never noticed it. I went to school, filled in some forms, talk to teachers and stuff. But when school was over, I remember on why would I be going to school? School was already over for me. Suddenly, everyone disappeared. I went to use a public phone but then one teacher surprised me and then the public phone turned into a walkie talkie. I started to panic. I went into my car and then it drove by itself. The teacher was also flirting with me before that. Panicking getting worst. I tried calling my mom through the phone in the car but I couldn't. Then I realized that I don't have a phone in the car. The numbers started to change and having duplicates, making it useless. My panic goes critical and I screamed in vain.\r\n\r\nThe car then was involved in an accident.
