Gay marriage has pretty much disappeared as the republican platform; what I mean by this is that the RNC is still officially against glbt rights and there are still republicans against it, *BUT* for the most part they have officially thrown in the towel and slowly walking away from it acting like they weren't involved.  The reason why is pretty apparent in the usa I believe it's at 60% of americans now support glbt rights.\r\n\r\nBasically if there was a bill to legalize gay marriage in congress, although the chances of it actually reaching the floor is small, what would probably happen is you'd see at least a hundred people abstaining from voting on it or \"out\" or \"sick with the flu\" that day.\r\n\r\nTo use a analogy it's like a dude that got in a car wreck and when the police officer told him he's going to have to pay for the damages he makes a run for it when the officer is going to get his ticket.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5388a484636872259a0c0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I turned 17 today","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"5388a4ea63687225e33f0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5388a484636872259a0c0200#post_5388a484636872259a0c0200\r\nYou're no longer jailbait where I live :V","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5388a51963687227e78a0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5388a36963687225e34d0100#post_5388a36963687225e34d0100\r\nRight on baby.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5388a484636872259a0c0200#post_5388a484636872259a0c0200\r\nHAPPY BIRTHDAY!","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"5388a623636872257cc40200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5388a4ea63687225e33f0200#post_5388a4ea63687225e33f0200\r\nInteresting\r\n\r\n\r\n\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5388a51963687227e78a0200#post_5388a51963687227e78a0200\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nI'm planning on getting a PSP And SRW Z2","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"5388a6a0636872257cf90200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5388a4ea63687225e33f0200#post_5388a4ea63687225e33f0200\r\nReally?
