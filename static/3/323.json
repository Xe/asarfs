We can grow as much as we need and don't have to invest much in the infrastructure for it. Because it can grow almost anywhere it will not compete with farmland or any other kind of desirable land. We could grow the algae way out in the desert where no crops could grow or even out at sea.

Look up the Valley of the Moon for example. The Atacama is the driest place in the world so dehydration most certainly could be a problem however to put in artificial lakes in a place which has been without water for millions of years could very well upset its ecosystem. I feel a much better way would be to either have it trucked in using trucks running on natural fuel or run an above ground pipe. But that's just getting the water there, what about waste water? A septic system would not work in the desert as the soil would have issues absorbing the water. It could of course just evaporate but then you have issues with the water leaving contaminates in the ground plus you have issues with increasing the humidity in that area which could have an effect on the weather. A sewer system could work and I think would be the best way to go as the water could be somewhat recycled. As far as plants, try growing Amaranth, it's a very nutritious plant that can grow in many places including places with little water and needs very little care to grow it.","author":"5010fa077f123b1e4f00104e"},{"id":"537d8830636872406a220000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/537d86c96368720a18ce0000#post_537d86c96368720a18ce0000\r\n\"They already grow algae in the desert in basically shallow pools.\":http://earthrise.com/about/farm.php ","author":"5010fa077f123b1e4f00104e"},{"id":"537d88a06368723f1e1e0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@someguy111\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/537d8830636872406a220000#post_537d8830636872406a220000\r\nInteresting...\r\nWhy hasn't any nation start doing this on a large scale yet?","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"537d88b9636872406a5e0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@someguy111\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/537d87c66368723ea6140000#post_537d87c66368723ea6140000\r\nThere is barely anything living in the Atacama in the first place, just a few arthropods, some cacti and maybe lizards.
