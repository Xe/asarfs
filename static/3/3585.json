I connected to it once when we were setting it up to test it, and when we were done he told me to just switch back to the regular connection and use that instead. However, I only did a speed test with it, and I didn't see how anything else would run on it. Apparently my computer actually can't handle the more powerful connection, and from that one time I connected to it a while ago, it would automatically connect me to the connection that doesn't work right for my laptop. I noticed it happened about every time I would shut down and reboot or restart my computer, I would start it up on the other connection instead of the one that actually works better for my computer.\r\n\r\nAnd I only just now realized this.\r\n\r\nI'm a dumbass\r\n\r\nDear brain,\r\n!http://i.imgur.com/cRzGrrO.gif!","author":"9ba2e84e636164642cc03200"},{"id":"54c550b86368720a67361c00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@EHAN\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54c5502c636872132d7d0d00#post_54c5502c636872132d7d0d00\r\nSo the problem was it had WAY to much Power?
