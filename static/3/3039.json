FPS games *total combined revenue* is going downhill sales wise and other franchises and genres are gaining popularity.  If you're wondering what I mean by this is that right now the action & puzzle genre are growing in popularity and becoming the new \"in\" thing.\r\n\r\nThe only real reason why I can guess fps games still get the majority of the attention is that those fps studios just don't know how to compete financially.\r\n\r\nTl:dr; ten years ago MMO games used to be the \"in\" thing; then the \"in\" thing was fps games; now the \"in\" thing is action and puzzle genre games.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54a997b96368723cdde40000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"*I-NA-ZU-MA KIIIIIIIIIIICK!*","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54a997ec63687233133c0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"On episode 2 of Gunbuster. \r\n\r\n\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a9969d636872396c1e0000#post_54a9969d636872396c1e0000\r\nIts because of games like CoD, Like MMO's and how they all at a time were getting popular because of stuff like WoW pushing the them forward FPS games got a lot of attention cuz they wanted that CoD cash. or at least that's how I see it.\r\n\r\nWoW was popular, LETS MAKE WoW GAMES, CoD is popular, LETS MAKE CoD GAMES. \r\n\r\nI can only imagine what the next craze will be, Can you imagine everyone wanting to make more Action games like Devil May Cry and Bayo? \r\n\r\nOr maybe more games like Gotcha Force?\r\n\r\n","author":"50c204917f123b31440000a5"},{"id":"54a997ff6368722fbbfa0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a997b96368723cdde40000#post_54a997b96368723cdde40000\r\nTHAT BITCH AINT FEELEN NO MORE!
