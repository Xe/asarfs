Call me weird but I'm not into emulated games.\r\nI like playing them on the original hardware with it's flaws and whatnot.\r\n\r\n[spoiler]This is why I don't play Playstation 1 games on PS3 for instance, since it's only an emulator. (That and having to hook up my PS3 with RGB to my PVM when I already use HDMI) Heck, I don't even play them on my PS2 since I wanted a reason to have a PS1 as well since I'm into collecting and such. (Besides, I believe the drive read speed might be faster, I at least recall a fuction to turn it to fast in the BIOS)[/spoiler]","author":"5012e49c7f123b4012000341"},{"id":"54a799d06368725cab330400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a796e06368720695910000#post_54a796e06368720695910000\r\n[bq=\"SquiggyBomb\"]\"@Twisty\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a796846368720695530000#post_54a796846368720695530000\r\nShe's a tengu who's really fast and has her own paper.\r\n\r\n[/bq]\r\n\r\nis the writes her own papers part because i write articles on KYM?\r\n","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"54a799e06368723e647f0500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Twisty\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a7998763687231da2f0300#post_54a7998763687231da2f0300\r\nWhat your location on KYM said.\r\nI know what you meant, I was making a joke.","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"54a799e263687234c8090200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@ArcticEight\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a799b66368723b31620600#post_54a799b66368723b31620600\r\nWhat about HD rereleases like Okami and Jet Set Radio?","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54a799f663687264183d0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Twisty\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a799d06368725cab330400#post_54a799d06368725cab330400\r\nThat works.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54a79a0e6368726418540200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Carcass Strife\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a799e06368723e647f0500#post_54a799e06368723e647f0500\r\n[bq=\"Carcass Strife\"]\"@Twisty\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a7998763687231da2f0300#post_54a7998763687231da2f0300\r\nWhat your location on KYM said.\r\nI know what you meant, I was making a joke.[/bq]\r\n\r\noh\r\n\r\ni didint got what you were reffering to.\r\n","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"54a79a136368725cab690400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a799e263687234c8090200#post_54a799e263687234c8090200\r\nSadly I'm a boring purist even with HD remasters and remakes.
