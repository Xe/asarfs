Even though the game music MIDI it blows even AAA mainstream music out of the fucking water with a depthcharge.  One of the hardest questions you can ask any touhou fan is to name their top favorite songs; it's just impossible cause the music will rock your face clean off.  To put it in perspective every year gaku and all the touhoutards update a list of best music in the touhou fandom and uploads them to torrents and such all organized and rated; the folder for things rate 9.5 out of 10 or above when I tried to download it was like 1.2 terabytes and the entire torrent was like 140 terabytes.  To put that in perspective that's *23 YEARS* worth of music.[/bq]\r\n\r\nEeyup.\r\n\r\n\"Koumajou Densetsu Scarlet Symphony (Touhouvania) Soundtrack\":https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL36Ftd6mNB15mWllPSw198gey6XTAJ3R2\r\n\"Koumajou Densetsu II Stranger's Requiem OST\":https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL051E3D21536C3BE5","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"54c480826368722175af0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54c4806b6368720d60650900#post_54c4806b6368720d60650900\r\nAn awesome stand gun!","author":"50c204917f123b31440000a5"},{"id":"54c480a363687226e2110900","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54c4806b6368720d60650900#post_54c4806b6368720d60650900\r\nA gun that only appears when he wants it.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54c480ab6368722175cc0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Carcass Strife\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54c47fe463687275b2700c00#post_54c47fe463687275b2700c00\r\nIt's supposed to be Master asia as Cure passion.","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"54c480f26368722175150200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SeraphimDawn\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54c4807363687206dbea0200#post_54c4807363687206dbea0200\r\nFUCKING THANK YOU!\r\nI've been looking for that OST for-fucking-ever!","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54c480f663687226e2530900","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54c480a363687226e2110900#post_54c480a363687226e2110900\r\nwell yeah, that's how all the stands work\r\n\r\n\r\nalso\r\num\r\n[spoiler]AVDOL JUST FUCKING DIED[/spoiler]","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"54c4810e636872323bf30700","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54c480f663687226e2530900#post_54c480f663687226e2530900\r\nYup.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54c4812f63687212b8210500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54c480f26368722175150200#post_54c480f26368722175150200\r\nNo problem man.","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"54c481326368723e27260c00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54c480ab6368722175cc0100#post_54c480ab6368722175cc0100\r\nOkay....\r\n","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"54c481ab6368726828e80000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54c480ab6368722175cc0100#post_54c480ab6368722175cc0100\r\nG Gundam was dumb, but I liked it cause it was the awesome kind of dumb.\r\n\r\nI don't think I can name a single other franchise where the main characters do a tango dance that summons a magic fist spade thingy that summons the burger king.
