Traditional animation is expensive to the point you're starting to see cgi in even cartoons and anime now to cut down costs.  A lot of times it's easy to notice, but if done well it can be hard to notice.  The reason why cgi is so often easy to notice in traditional 2d animation is 95% of the time the person they get to do it is a fresh rookie out of college and most audiences have seen cgi so much they have learned how to immediately pick it out.\r\n\r\nPersonally that's why I like RWBY's art style, cause they realized \"Blending in cgi with traditional animation is really hard to do. . eh fuck it we'll just make it cgi and stylize it as anime\".  It's probably why there's so many cgi only movies cause your average audience member can immediately pick out what's cgi when it's used in live action movies or animated movies.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"5389f4fe636872251ccc0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Why do people treat CGI like it's a bad thing?
