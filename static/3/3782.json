WataMote. Watashi ga Motenai no wa Dou Kangaetemo Omaera ga Warui. It's Not My Fault That I'm Not Popular. I know precious little about this series, but I have to admit that it caught my eye. So for anyone who's seen it, I need to ask: how is it?\r\n\r\n[spoiler]Also, it has a dub? I had no idea. I'll probably watch the subbed version first, though.[/spoiler][/bq]\r\nWatamote is good, in my opinion, and it seems a lot of people identifies a lot with the character (you will see why).\r\nIt has good humor and good episodes.
