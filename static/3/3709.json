I need $50 from your parent's bank accounts\"\r\nA lot of Anita Sarkeesian's kickstarter supporters have become anti-sjw because they've been physically growing up; back then the majority of them were people in their mid-teens and now they're either out of high school or about to get out of high school.\r\nExamples: a fair chunk of anti-sjw were originally sjw.\r\n3)The people in it for money.\r\nExample: Wu is a millionaire and constantly begs for money online.\r\n4)People just straight up in the dark about the true nature of the movement.  The reason why I don't ever act like a shitbag to sjw is because the vast majority of them do believe in equality, but they don't know what the organization they're a part of actually does.  Think about it as like members of PETA; the vast majority of their members don't know that PETA kills thousands of animals a year.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54cdd15263687240f0240900","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Pffft","author":"4fdef063945b700a9d01604f"},{"id":"54cdd18f63687224ddf20800","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54cdd1196368724fda761000#post_54cdd1196368724fda761000\r\nHmmmmmmm.\r\nI feel like it's going to be less Matrix and more Ghost in the Shell.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54cdd1bd6368722211fc1000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54cdd15063687240f0210900#post_54cdd15063687240f0210900\r\nFuking ice cream cake tho...","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"54cdd1c46368724fdaa51000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54cdd1196368724fda761000#post_54cdd1196368724fda761000\r\n[bq=\"mariomarc\"]!https://36.media.tumblr.com/41311cbd1106c9716861e7ff44532e9f/tumblr_niurxeKMQS1qkwdrko1_540.jpg!\r\n\"Source\":http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2927410/The-real-life-Matrix-MIT-researchers-reveal-interface-allow-computer-plug-brain.html\r\n\r\nresponses from tumblr\r\n1: AUGMENT ME NOWWWWWWWWWWWW\r\n2: Augment my dick so I can fuck the system.\r\n3: TIME TO BE ONE WJTH MY WIAFIUS\r\n4: THIS CAN ONLY LEAD TO RUIN.[/bq]\r\nIt's probably going to be #1 cause that was the major hurdle for cyborgs and such.\r\n\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54cdd18f63687224ddf20800#post_54cdd18f63687224ddf20800\r\n[bq=\"SquiggyBomb\"]\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54cdd1196368724fda761000#post_54cdd1196368724fda761000\r\nHmmmmmmm.\r\nI feel like it's going to be less Matrix and more Ghost in the Shell.[/bq]\r\nPretty much.\r\n\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54cdcee66368723368200400#post_54cdcee66368723368200400\r\n[bq=\"trashboat\"]!http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/prettycure/images/9/95/Wolf.full_body.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120805165833!\r\nWolfrun from Smile Precure.
