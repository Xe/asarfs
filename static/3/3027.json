I still stick to that people are drastically over estimating boku no hero academia and that people are drastically over estimating shonen cause they think every person on the planet likes it and worships it, but the day something that isn't a shonen is top dog is the day that I break out the confetti, streamers and balloons I have saved for CoD's inevitable demise cause I stick CoD and shonen in the same boat of you have to like it and if you don't like it then there's something \"wrong\" with you; the reaction by both groups isn't that \"oh that person has different tastes in mass media\" rather the reaction is always \"there's something physically wrong with this person for not liking this\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReason why I hate shonen summarized as succintly as humanly possible: how the shonen fanbase treats those not interested, \"if you don't like shonen it's not because you have different tastes in mass media but because there's something physically wrong with you\".\r\n\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a8ad45636872764ace0500#post_54a8ad45636872764ace0500\r\nI never said that I was better than them; rather I hate shonen cause if you don't like it then according to shonen fans there's something physically \"wrong\" with you.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54a8adb86368726a87830000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a8ad5a63687271cbb20500#post_54a8ad5a63687271cbb20500\r\nI've never had that problem.\r\nAll the dudes I talk manga with are the coolest guys.
