Since the recession the number of children per couple has been steadily and constantly going down for the simple reason couples can no longer afford having plenty of children; removing tax breaks for married couples would add onto this and further reduce birth rates.  The thing to keep in mind though is that for a country to be economically stable one of the biggest thing is to have a stable or growing population; if a population is in decline that can and will cause large scale economic stagnation.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"537ec9a76368724792070000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"How we'll resurrect the thylacine and gastric-brooding frog.\":http://www.ted.com/talks/michael_archer_how_we_ll_resurrect_the_gastric_brooding_frog_the_tasmanian_tiger \r\n\"Building a dinosaur from a chicken.\":http://www.ted.com/talks/jack_horner_building_a_dinosaur_from_a_chicken \r\n\"Bring back the woolly mammoth!\":https://www.ted.com/talks/hendrik_poinar_bring_back_the_woolly_mammoth\r\n\"Will our kids be different species?\":https://www.ted.com/talks/juan_enriquez_will_our_kids_be_a_different_species \r\n\r\nI want my stem cell mammoth burger and I want it now.","author":"50b70eeb7f123b1a02000097"},{"id":"537ec9c563687248be0e0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@someguy111\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/537ec535636872620d070000#post_537ec535636872620d070000\r\n[bq=\"someguy111\"]\"@Whatevs\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/537ec3f46368722c275e0000#post_537ec3f46368722c275e0000\r\nActually _you_ are the one thinking with feelings; you are basing these \"laws\" on your own hate/dislike for marriage equality, basically \"I don't like them gays so I'm gonna make it so they are treated differently because my personal preference to sexual orientation should interfere with someone's private life.\" \r\n\r\nI hate smoking, like _really_ hate it.
