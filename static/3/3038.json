If the new ghost in the shell game is story intensive I'll totally play it.  What I probably hate the most in video games would be the Call of Duty thing where the same game year after year after year after year after year after year is constantly released just with updated graphics.  If you look at Deux Ex Human Revolution versus the previous Deus Ex game that was a drastic improvement on every level.  A game doesn't have to redefine the world, it just has to do it well and if it's a ongoing series try to inovate the game and improve the games.\r\n\r\nWhat I would like most to see in video gaming is the return to story intensine games and that is what sets certain games above each other; they don't have to have the best graphics, they just have to be have a good story and good gameplay.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54a990676368725289000000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Hey guys, whatchall talking about?","author":"5307a92d6368722c6c0d0100"},{"id":"54a9909763687258dd050000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Zak_Inc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a990676368725289000000#post_54a990676368725289000000\r\nUc9 is hating on how the Ghost in the shell game is an FPS, And Squiggybomb and Number1pegasus are watching Gunbuster.","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"54a990eb6368725d03430000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a98f646368726099050d00#post_54a98f646368726099050d00\r\nIts also Hilarious!\r\n\r\nWhat is this G Gundam!

Look at what happened to Destiny; look at how must money it generated, now name me one thing you know about where The Traveller came from or what The Darkness is or even something as simple as what the main character's back story is.  Story intensive video games just don't produce nearly as much revenue.\r\n\r\nYou can totally call me a asshole here, but it's why I'm giggling like crazy about how Call of Duty is financially going downhill because there's simply no other large scale franchise for the video game industry to latch onto popularity wise, fps games are no longer top in sales or popularity and the most played online video game right now is LoL and LoL nobody can compete with financially to the point not even Dota tries to compete with them head on.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"}]}
