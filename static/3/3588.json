It has to be family friendly and it can't be a complex plot movie.  The reason why I ask is that I have one chance to get someone that absolutely hates anime without ever having watched a single one to try to get them to try other shows and such.  It has to be a single movie and if you don't get them interested then you've blown it forever.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54c59cb86368726070be0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54c59c846368726d7e260100#post_54c59c846368726d7e260100\r\n\r\n-DAMN IT THE MOVIE I PICKED WAS AKIRA-","author":"540d16a363687229a2180200"},{"id":"54c59cbe636872626a820000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Number1pegasus\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54c59c7563687260b6250100#post_54c59c7563687260b6250100\r\nOoo\r\n\r\n\"Get ready to hear this\":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TX6K0RH12zo ","author":"505696b47f123b37e800effa"},{"id":"54c59cf363687261e5920000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54c59c846368726d7e260100#post_54c59c846368726d7e260100\r\nWolf Children.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54c59d216368726649b10100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Asahina\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54c59cb86368726070be0000#post_54c59cb86368726070be0000\r\nI keep forgetting this, but you're Carcass' sister right?  or am I thinking of someone else?","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54c59d606368726649c00100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54c59d216368726649b10100#post_54c59d216368726649b10100\r\nMiyo's sister actually.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54c59d956368726c15410000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@igotnopicks\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54c59cbe636872626a820000#post_54c59cbe636872626a820000\r\nOoooh! \r\n\r\n\r\n\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54c59c846368726d7e260100#post_54c59c846368726d7e260100\r\nHowls moving Castle!","author":"50c204917f123b31440000a5"},{"id":"54c59dcb6368726623410000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54c59d606368726649c00100#post_54c59d606368726649c00100\r\nI sure hope she doesn't find the nfsw threads otherwise that'll get awkward.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54c59e216368726cc8570000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54c59d216368726649b10100#post_54c59d216368726649b10100\r\nI think it's Carcass' brother or cousin that's on here.\r\nEHAN is related to someone as well.","author":"515ddf93a4c72d8a1f000d57"},{"id":"54c59e26636872680a110000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54c59c846368726d7e260100#post_54c59c846368726d7e260100\r\nhmmmm So Anime movies that are family friendly try to get people off of Anime.\r\n\r\nHmmmmm\r\nOne of the DBZ movies.","author":"505696b47f123b37e800effa"},{"id":"54c59e476368726c15700000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"[spoiler]Poor ol' Snow White is looking roooouuugh.[/spoiler]","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54c59e6e6368726a05330000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@ParagonCommander\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54c59e216368726cc8570000#post_54c59e216368726cc8570000\r\nI have a sister.\r\nSHE DOESNT COME HERE\r\nYOU ARE THINKING OF SONEONE ELSE","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"}]}
