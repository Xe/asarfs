Of course there buildings were mostly for the rich and for royalty who  could afford to have hundreds or even thousands of workers building their mansion for several years. It simply would not be possible, even today, to build such incredible structures as it would be very expensive and consume a lot of land and resources, in others worlds: they don't make 'em like they used to.","author":"5010fa077f123b1e4f00104e"}]}
