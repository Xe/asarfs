I know I sound like a broken record about what I call \"the naruto effect\" but it's the same deal; right now there's a ton of video games that financially die because they're not call of duty; Yozakura Quartet failed because it was not Naruto.\r\n\r\nI'll admit Yozakura Quartet isn't a masterpiece, but it's far from a bad show which sucks that it was one of the franchises that financially got fucked over cause of Naruto's popularity causing a detrimental effect on the anime industry.  A lot of people aren't fans of the genre or such that's totally understandable and if someone reading this that checks out the show doesn't like it, but it really sucks that the show failed popularity wise because it wasn't a naruto clone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf like non-black and white story telling set in a supernatural setting then I would suggest checking it out.  On the other hand if you're a naruto fan I would not suggest watching it cause across the board naruto fans, with no exaggeration at all, seem to outright hate the series.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54b462f663687278a5c50700","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SeraphimDawn\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54b462a063687272e20b0500#post_54b462a063687272e20b0500\r\n[spoiler]I don't actually think that as I've never seen touhou other than that one thing, I just want to piss Uc9 off because I think he's a huge brat who won't stop whining about how the Shonenz are more popular than the shit he's into.[/spoiler]","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"}]}
