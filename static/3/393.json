In ten years time synthesized food will have in all probability replaced natural food because farms and ranches will no longer be able to compete thus being forced out of business.  So in all reality your *ONLY* choices would be to eat the synthesized food, pay $1000 per steak, have your own farm or starve to death.  Also I have had a sustenance farm before, and I know how back breaking it is, anyone that says they're going to grow their own food speaking from personal experience is a outright liar.  I have had my own farm before; so yeah I'm going to have to call bullshit on anyone that says they're going to grow all their own food.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"538a974a6368724ed77e0500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/538a96c96368724c61570500#post_538a96c96368724c61570500\r\nI think 10 years is too soon for anything like that to happen.","author":"5010fa077f123b1e4f00104e"},{"id":"538a97e86368724ebd880600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@someguy111\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/538a974a6368724ed77e0500#post_538a974a6368724ed77e0500\r\nThe reason why right now we don't have synthesized food is that if it were to go into mass production right now it would cost twice as much.
