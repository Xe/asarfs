Architecture is a form of art, like a language of some sort. At the same time, functional. And this is the case for thousands of years of civilization. There is a reason people cycled to certain classical styles for a long time since antiquity. It's sort of like a \"Feng shui\":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feng_shui type of thing. A harmony between humans, buildings, and nature.","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"5389139f6368726e389a0400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Has anyone here heard of Cutie honey?","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"538913a26368726e389c0400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SeraphimDawn\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/538912f26368726e2c200400#post_538912f26368726e2c200400\r\nIt's extravagance instead of necessity, there are still beautiful homes today but they are only for the rich.

What's more is the more people we have the more pollution we make which makes crops even harder to grow as if there wasn't a shortage already.
