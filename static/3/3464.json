[/bq]\r\nThere is such a thing as bad publicity, rather most of the time whenever the news tries to create a moral panic they most of the time go the route of \"don't do this cool thing\".  Geek culture is already insanely popular in the usa; if 24/7 news tries to create another moral panic the long term fallout would be geek culture would be propelled so far in popularity that chances are you'd see people show up to work in cosplay and it be considered normal.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat do I mean by this?  Well let's look at video games; video games are fucking insanely popular in the usa.  The best estimate of how many people play video games, excluding cellphone games or facebook games and such, is 200 million out of the 310 million people living in the usa.  The reason why it doesn't seem nearly as much is because most of those 200 million people only play video games once in a while and by no means are hardcore gamers; like they have a couple games that they love and play on a regular basis but they are in no way dropping forty hours a week on the game, sure they'll play five or so hours a week playing games but they're still playing video games.\r\n\r\nAnyways that was just to illustrate a point; things mainstream culture in the usa deems to be geeky are *WAY* the fuck more popular than 24/7 news realize.  IF 24/7 news in the usa declares a culture war on geek culture then they would be declaring a culture war on the supermajority of the usa population and that will be hilarious.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54befc4a6368727b41140300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@EHAN\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54beeeba6368724a14660600#post_54beeeba6368724a14660600\r\n[bq=\"EHAN\"]\"@EHAN\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54beed386368726c381d1e00#post_54beed386368726c381d1e00\r\n[bq=\"EHAN\"]\"@EHAN\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54beebe56368724fbcfa1e00#post_54beebe56368724fbcfa1e00\r\n[bq=\"EHAN\"]\"@ToskiHero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54bd33a76368722c029c0400#post_54bd33a76368722c029c0400\r\n[bq=\"ToskiHero\"]Holy crap did I just beat Nightfall in under 4:30?\r\nI think I just did.[/bq]\r\nI beat it in 4:04 :D[/bq]\r\nGot it down to 4:03[/bq]\r\n4:02, I think sub 4 minutes is possible but will be extremely difficult[/bq]\r\nSub 4 is definitely possible, I just destroyed my record and got 3:46","author":"9ba2e84e636164642cc03200"},{"id":"54befc52636872342a2b3300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Carcass Strife\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54befb9a63687259046b0000#post_54befb9a63687259046b0000\r\n[bq=\"Carcass Strife\"]\"@Number1pegasus\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54befb616368727b41cf0200#post_54befb616368727b41cf0200\r\nMAKE A FRICKING CHOICE, ALREADY![/bq]\r\nEXACTLY!","author":"50c204917f123b31440000a5"},{"id":"54befc5a6368727679fd0800","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Shadow the Hedgehog\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54befbda63687276e1d20b00#post_54befbda63687276e1d20b00\r\nOh god.","author":"50c204917f123b31440000a5"},{"id":"54befca063687278d9aa1100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Shadow the Hedgehog\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54befbda63687276e1d20b00#post_54befbda63687276e1d20b00\r\n!http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20111201235005/muppet/images/a/a9/Muppets_Number_1.jpg!","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"54befd1b6368725b3afb0f00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@EHAN\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54befc4a6368727b41140300#post_54befc4a6368727b41140300\r\n[bq=\"EHAN\"]\"@EHAN\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54beeeba6368724a14660600#post_54beeeba6368724a14660600\r\n[bq=\"EHAN\"]\"@EHAN\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54beed386368726c381d1e00#post_54beed386368726c381d1e00\r\n[bq=\"EHAN\"]\"@EHAN\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54beebe56368724fbcfa1e00#post_54beebe56368724fbcfa1e00\r\n[bq=\"EHAN\"]\"@ToskiHero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54bd33a76368722c029c0400#post_54bd33a76368722c029c0400\r\n[bq=\"ToskiHero\"]Holy crap did I just beat Nightfall in under 4:30?\r\nI think I just did.[/bq]\r\nI beat it in 4:04 :D[/bq]\r\nGot it down to 4:03[/bq]\r\n4:02, I think sub 4 minutes is possible but will be extremely difficult[/bq]\r\nSub 4 is definitely possible, I just destroyed my record and got 3:46[/bq]\r\nAre we doing this again?","author":"5239db6da4c72d22d9000358"},{"id":"54befdd36368727dba600000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Carcass Strife\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54befca063687278d9aa1100#post_54befca063687278d9aa1100\r\nAnd now we have American Sniper as #1 movie\r\n\r\nBut remember this !http://www.dan-dare.org/FreeFun/Images/CMTVMore/JamesCameronAvatarPoster.jpg!
