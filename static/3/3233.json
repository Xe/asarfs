If someone hates music in video games that's their personal preference; as for me I *LOVE* music, I just don't get why people hate music in games or such. 95% of the time in real life I always have headphones on and constantly listening to music; music is my life man, I legitimately don't understand the people that dislike music cause I *LOVE* music, they have the right to dislike music but I don't why some people hate music.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54b467316368727b3d890400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54b46434636872790e470200#post_54b46434636872790e470200\r\nI admit that Naruto's fanbase is stupid, But you're acting like they're all like that.\r\n\r\nI really don't like being angry.

That's the absolute truth.\r\n\r\nMusic has always been a gray area, same as humour. That's free will and freedom of speech. For every person that says something is awesome, there has to be someone who says it's crap. No matter how stupid it is.\r\n\r\nI personally don't mind it, cause it's necessary.
