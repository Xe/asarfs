If entropy didn't exist then the big bang couldn't have happened therefore life could have never happened.  If we were to reverse entropy then the universe would reverse it's direction eventually ending with a big crunch and the universe reverting to it's original state of being a singular point.  If we were to change the universe where to dark matter and gravity were equal, basically negating entropy, then life couldn't exist either.  Getting really poetic here but it's like the concept of yin and yang; two opposing forces that on the surface seem to be incompatible but as a whole are part of a larger balance.  Without entropy life couldn't exist; without gravity and such the universe would instantly die.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54b561a26368727a115c0700","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs7/i/2005/178/d/7/Eva_Unit_02_by_Afroerror.jpg!","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"54b561c96368723608311900","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Bryon\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54b561506368722df69e1300#post_54b561506368722df69e1300\r\nI dunno, they were \"blinding\" out.","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"54b563426368723437a00f00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"So I found a series called Ar Tonelico.
