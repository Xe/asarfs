The problem with that immediately is people like me; you could give me all the power in the world and I could control the world politically, economically, societally and to such a point that I could control everything, but you know how I would abuse that?  Blackjack and hookers for everyone!\r\n\r\nThe problem with a lot of philosophies and people that say humans are fundamentally evil is that you have to learn how to be \"evil\"; no one started out as a toddler wanting to hurt others in the belief that hurting others was what was best for the person you're hurting.\r\n\r\nTl:dr; A lot of people are full of shit cause they ignore learned behaviour.

What I mean by this is to use a analogy think of a herd of animals; would acting as a single unit be a good evolutionary trait?  Would being selfish be good for the whole of the herd?  Even a lot of predatory animals show basic thinking about the health of the species rather than themselves.  To use a analogy think of how when cats know they're going to die they run off.  It's a basic evolutionary trait of they don't know why they're sick and dying, but they still run off in case it's a virus or such from being transmitted to others.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"538954a663687211f4cd0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5389539b63687210461b0100#post_5389539b63687210461b0100\r\nChimps tend to be quite hostile to chimps from another group enough to kill each other, even the peace-loving bonobos will sometimes kill members of other groups just because they are from a different part of the jungle...just like humans.","author":"5010fa077f123b1e4f00104e"},{"id":"53895f9b636872112c7c0600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"you know what i fnd funny.\r\n\r\n50 cent was featured in a song bashing rap music that was simplistic and only had catchy hooks.\r\n\r\nbut you have listened to 50´s music, you will see the irony there.","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"5389605c63687212e6e90500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@twistedmetalero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53895f9b636872112c7c0600#post_53895f9b636872112c7c0600\r\nBlur's \"Song 2\" was meant to be a parody of \"rock/punk\" music at the time and turned out to be their most popular song.","author":"5010fa077f123b1e4f00104e"},{"id":"538960c0636872119a380600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2010/295/d/c/ooh_chief_chujo_by_fauna93-d319i5r.jpg!","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"538960cb6368721116d60600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@someguy111\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5389605c63687212e6e90500#post_5389605c63687212e6e90500\r\n\r\nswag me out, BSD and trashwang were suppose to be parodies of todays rap talking about getting bitches and money.\r\n\r\nyet those are the songs odd future fans love the most.\r\n\r\nthats gotta like hurt, as an artist.","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"5389693c636872269d490200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I've reached the quarter of a century","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"53896995636872280bc80200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@QuasarNova\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5389693c636872269d490200#post_5389693c636872269d490200\r\nCongratulations.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"538969f163687224f7e10200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/53896995636872280bc80200#post_53896995636872280bc80200\r\n\r\nThanks.
