Originally they were intended to represent James' sexual frustration and desire to cheat on his ill wife, right? Well why are they in the movie if the protagonist is female? Could it be she's a closeted lesbian or bisexual? The question of why they're nurses comes up but maybe it could be a combination of Elissa's psyche and the protagonist's. \r\n\r\nThen there's pyramid head. In silent hill two, again it was a manifestation of sexual frustration but also possibly of the guilt of either James' desires or the possibility that he did in fact cheat on his dying wife. What could that mean for rosa? \r\nWell maybe rosa grew up in a very conservative household who didn't approve of her sexuality.(this could also be why the cult in the town seems to be made up of Christians rather than spyromancers like the original game) Although again, pyramid head is meant to be sort of a punisher of the guilty. Maybe Rosa was feeling guilty about something she was feeling. \r\nMaybe towards Sybil, the attractive lady cop that she just so happens to be trapped with. Maybe rosa was thinking about Sybil instead of her husband who was probably worried sick about her. \r\n\r\nThen there's the lying figure. Originally intended to represent disgust at seeing a loved one dying, trapped in a hospital bed, angry at the world. Not really valid in the movie since there's nobody like that (except Elissa who rosa has no knowledge of for most of the movie) \r\nBut an alternative interpretation (and a fairly easy one at that) is someone who feels trapped in their own skin. Maybe rosa was sick of hiding her sexuality\r\nOr maybe she was in fact transsexual. Either born male or uncomfortable being female. Maybe that's why they adopted. \r\n\r\nAs for Elissa's mother being totally different from her original self, shatter memories establishes that people who are eternally trapped in silent hill can change drastically. That's kinda bullshitting but meh so is the rest of this.
