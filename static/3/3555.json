Here's more of that.\"\r\nand The Crew was plagued with massive technical issues from the very start.\r\n\r\nChild of Light was fantastic, I can't say enough good about it (and even that is just my opinion, plenty of people are indifferent to it), so there's a 1/6 success rate.\r\n\r\nI think they need to really step the hell back and remember that they're ONE company, and that ONE company should really not be putting out half a dozen games in a single year.","author":"4fde03f9945b7016fb00022a"},{"id":"54c373c86368724d63290a00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Evident Disaster\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54c372ae6368726830e50d00#post_54c372ae6368726830e50d00\r\nSorry, no clue about scripting.
