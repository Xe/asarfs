Think about how popular video games, anime, manga, my little pony, DnD, Science Fiction, larping, Fantasy and all of geek culture is nowadays.  If the 90's moral panic is what helped propel geek culture into the mainstream imagine what another moral panic will do?  Basically what I'm getting at is if there is another 90's moral panic geek culture will take control of usa culture.\r\n\r\nAlso side note: I remember the 90's moral panic about geek culture pretty damn well; I actually enjoyed the unity geeks felt about the news media threat cause there was next to no inter-fandom drama; all the different fandoms were united against the \"moral guardians\" cause they all felt that defending themselves against the greater threat was more important.\r\n\r\nTl:dr; if 24/7 usa news tries to create another moral panic about geek culture then chances are that'll only cause geek culture to take control of mainstream culture in the usa.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54bef3b06368725a173b0400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Shadow the Hedgehog\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54bef3336368726c38192000#post_54bef3336368726c38192000\r\nFUCKING RIGHT!\r\n\r\n","author":"50c204917f123b31440000a5"},{"id":"54bef49b6368727a774f0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Now admittedly the load screen is pretty cool because it's just Old Snake smoking, but sixteen minutes is just poor optimization.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54bef4fc636872462ffe0900","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54bef49b6368727a774f0100#post_54bef49b6368727a774f0100\r\nAnd it's really the whole collection?","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"54bef51363687264a2ff0400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Carcass Strife\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54bef4fc636872462ffe0900#post_54bef4fc636872462ffe0900\r\nNope.\r\nIt's just MGS4!","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54bef544636872024b1c2300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54bef49b6368727a774f0100#post_54bef49b6368727a774f0100\r\nThat's fucking bogus!
