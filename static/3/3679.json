Example- I can completely max it out after watching only a couple videos on Youtube, after which it becomes impossible to open any sort of program. Force-closing more memory intensive programs provides only a temporary fix, and even if I restart, it swallows up one of the six GBs dedicated to memory right off the bat.","author":"5043cdb47f123b72cc0032d3"},{"id":"54caee3d6368725bef433e00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I'm going to make another Gif.","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"54caee536368726f1b330300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@EHAN\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54caed3a636872673f1c0000#post_54caed3a636872673f1c0000\r\nAnd that I should duct tape uncle Parkinson. \r\n\r\nWho's epileptic","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"54caee7463687220e1c40100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54caee3d6368725bef433e00#post_54caee3d6368725bef433e00\r\nGood luck","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"54caee79636872673fa90000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54caee3d6368725bef433e00#post_54caee3d6368725bef433e00\r\nGif it up gifm'n!","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"54caeea96368720d1f750000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Silent_Witness\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54caee086368720d1f350000#post_54caee086368720d1f350000\r\nHonestly that sounds like you might have some sort of serious malware problem to me.","author":"4f41ee04945b701c41002af7"},{"id":"54caeee663687266dd7c0800","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://i.imgur.com/Zxb5oL2.jpg!\r\n\"Fuck, it's Bonnie.\"","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"54caef2a63687266ddbc0800","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@gasmaskangel\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54caeea96368720d1f750000#post_54caeea96368720d1f750000\r\nI'm not too sure about what it might be myself.
