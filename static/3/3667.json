Unlike Yuugi who just wants to drink until she passes out. Mokou would be the more relaxed one. Just pour some scotch, turn on the jazz, and relax.

It might be in English too.  I would like to see Hata No Kokoro in it though; it might happen cause lately Zun in the games seems to be expanding on the current characters.  Call me optimistic, but if it is coming out in the west then chances are they're going to put a lot of effort into \"Urban Legend in Limbo\" than they normally do; sure you can argue \"well they always put a lot of effort into the games\" what I mean is that if your game is coming out in another language that covers 300 million people and officially for the first time then you're going to damn make sure it's successful.\r\n\r\n\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54c9e67b63687234f8770b00#post_54c9e67b63687234f8770b00\r\nHow much has it changed?
