It's not that it's hard to learn, yes it is hard to learn, but the mindset of \"RTFM\".\r\n\r\nThe problem with this is that I don't have the book yet so how can someone learn from the book if they don't have the book.\r\n\r\nI found a online lesson that answered my question within the first two minutes.  So yeah I'm going to be paying attention to this guy cause he actually explains it instead of going, \"lol read it yourself\".  Honestly this kind of pisses me off cause the purpose of a professor is to teach obviously, but if they don't teach then are they actually a professor?  What I mean by this is what seems to be a huge problem with teaching programming is that professors don't do what is required in their job and expect the student to already learn.  The logical fallacy with this is that would be like a swimming instructor throwing a kid who can't swim into a swimming pool or a parachute instructor throwing a person out of a plane; the fallacy of this is that if you throw a kid who can't swim into a swimming pool there's a high chance they're going to drown or if you throw person out of plane they're going to go splat.\r\n\r\nIf you're a teacher or professor keep in mind this logical fallacy in that if you were a driving instructor would you first day have the student drive in New York traffic?  If you say yes then you massively need to rethink your teaching strategy.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"537a5203636872400eb40300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"if yall havent watched star_ videos you dont know what pure bliss is\":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47ddftKlehI \r\n\r\n","author":"5154c5237f123bcd580002fc"},{"id":"537a53156368721bc9c90400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://i522.photobucket.com/albums/w341/DragonboyGT/KamenRiderBlackRXExtremead_zpsbddf1962.jpg!","author":"5062d6f17f123b3e16001184"},{"id":"537a54136368722fd56d0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://assets.extremeadvertisements.com/hashed_silo_content/silo_content/5060/resized/hat.jpg!
