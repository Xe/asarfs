Your choice in that situation is to not have 3D printed houses and save tens of millions of people's mortgages and have them continue living in their houses *OR* have 3D printed houses and tens of millions of people's mortgages just evaporate overnight forcing them to sell their houses and move to the new nice houses; which is better 20 million people still keeping their homes or 200 million people having drastically lower rent and/or drastically lower cost housing?\r\n\r\nTake 3D printed organs, biomechatronics, repairing spinal damage, cryostasis and surgery robots; your choice is to in the long run keep millions of jobs intact or save hundreds of millions of lives through better medical treatment.\r\n\r\nGhost in the Shell: Stand Alone complex actually had a episode about this where a girl received a heart transplant from the black market from med students that took organs from people receiving cybernetics that would have normally been discarded because there was such pressure for everyone to receive cybernetics that if you didn't want to be a cyborg your only choices were to pay a insanely large bill to get a new organ that you couldn't realistically ever pay off in your lifetime/go to the black market or die.\r\n\r\n\r\nDo I think that's morally wrong?  No, cause every time there's a new technological advancement *SOMEONE* is going to lose their job.\r\n\r\nHell even my current job will probably last only 1-2 years because the print industry has taken a huge crap.  That's why I'm still going to go to school because my current job is rapidly becoming technologically obsolete.  Do I go around going \"fuck you internet!  You took muh job!\"; no cause that's just a side effect of technological advancement; often times the job market rapidly changes.  If anything I support technological advancement because the average wages of people worldwide taking into account inflation/deflation of their countries has gone drastically up and the quality of living worldwide on average is going up; sure the world is shitty, but it's becoming less shitty over time.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54d67ff96368721e30d62500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54d67e0f63687231a21c0000#post_54d67e0f63687231a21c0000\r\nSpidah-Man?","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"54d6810b63687242a0d13700","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Carcass Strife\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54d67ff96368721e30d62500#post_54d67ff96368721e30d62500\r\n\"Kinda want to here the spiderman song sung like this now\":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK3g-d5BO1M ","author":"509f70a87f123b77eb0004fd"},{"id":"54d6833163687207417c0400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54d67fb863687251b1a82100#post_54d67fb863687251b1a82100\r\n3D printed houses are something I completely would like. Housing should be a right. Yeah, I can see that the 3D printed organs having a potential to end the black market trade of illegally harvested organs. And possibly the end of the need of someone having to forfeit their body parts.\r\nBut the nanobots.... what if they go awry? Maybe I've been watching too many sci-fi stuff, but still...\r\n\r\nI still think there needs to be plans that aim to mitigate unemployment. Because things can get pretty ugly when people are pushed out of their jobs and are unable to get another forcing them to live in poverty. Heck, even university graduates have it hard when it comes to finding good jobs this day and age due to there simply being not enough jobs on the market. Not all people are built to be high skilled either. If I was a leader, I'd probably be the type who'd try to put the welfare of the people above unchecked progress if I have to. Maybe humanity has  progressed a little too far than we were intended to be. I think, the world is good as it is, despite the existing flaws.
