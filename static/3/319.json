He said that he's going to go out for the night instead to get away from the cops, but the reason why is I told him that the cops are coming.  I didn't tell him that I told the dean or anything; rather I told him the resident assistant wants him gone and the dean is coming for him and wants to get rid of him.  This has made him paranoid of having anymore parties at my apartment.\r\n\r\nSo his possible options are go elsewhere to party at which the cops will inspect this house at 10pm to which I can tell him, \"Man the cops were all up in the place looking for you.  Dude lay low cause if they catch any booze in here you're fucked\".  If he throws a party at this apartment he's going to get thrown out of school.  If he doesn't throw a party tonight he's going to see the cops and know they're eyeing him.  So even if he doesn't get arrested he's going to know the cops were here and will start getting super paranoid of them thinking that they're constantly watching the apartment or something at which point chances are I won't have to deal with anymore parties cause he's going to be paranoid to hold them here.\r\n\r\nTl:dr; I'm making my roommate super paranoid of the cops so that he won't have anymore parties here.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"537d193c6368726da0260000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/537d17c26368726841080000#post_537d17c26368726841080000\r\n\r\nI would say that's one competitor less, but considering the effort it requieres to properly know the logistics behind programming, I think you really can't give the luxury of losing a roommate, or I'm totally on the  wrong end?","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"537d19a063687269e8590000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@QuasarNova\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/537d193c6368726da0260000#post_537d193c6368726da0260000\r\nHe's in welding, not programming.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"537d1aa86368726837fa0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/537d19a063687269e8590000#post_537d19a063687269e8590000\r\n\r\n\r\nOh.
