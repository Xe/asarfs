If you're female, 18+, and you live in Japan, maybe you could go to a Host Club.\r\n\r\nLike hostess clubs, most host clubs do not offer actual sex; only flirting, flattery, pampering and companionship in a congenial environment (and at an exorbitant rate). Unlike hostess clubs, the main market for host clubs is not White Collar Workers, but, instead, women who work in hostess clubs and other parts of the entertainment industry, looking to relax after a long hard night of being nice to inebriated, sexually-harassing Salarymen (since host clubs are mostly owned by the same people who own hostess clubs, this has the net effect of recouping some of the hostess' income, and thus hostesses are encouraged to partake of this form of entertainment). \"","author":"5043cdb47f123b72cc0032d3"},{"id":"54b75b076368725e38050200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54b75a7963687267b1030200#post_54b75a7963687267b1030200\r\nA host club is a place where women go and pay hot guys to pretend to like them.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54b75b176368725cb8df0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Here a \"music video\":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPf0YbXqDm0\r\n","author":"505696b47f123b37e800effa"},{"id":"54b75b4d6368725ea4140200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54b75a7963687267b1030200#post_54b75a7963687267b1030200\r\nYou'd be the shy awkward one that all the girls would think is cute.","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54b75b6f6368726232f20100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54b75b076368725e38050200#post_54b75b076368725e38050200\r\nI have to agree with trash\r\nNot sure that's something I could actually do","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"54b75b716368725acba90200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54b75ae4636872687dbd0200#post_54b75ae4636872687dbd0200\r\nYusss","author":"500b587e7f123b1f230014a9"},{"id":"54b75b846368725bf1b80100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54b75b076368725e38050200#post_54b75b076368725e38050200\r\nSo like whenever someone asks you out on a date and asks you to pay the food bill and it turns out they were just wanting a free meal?","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54b75bb2636872604a740000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54b759b1636872693a4e0200#post_54b759b1636872693a4e0200\r\nI'm not really cut out for that line of work.","author":"5043cdb47f123b72cc0032d3"}]}
