I would give them a glare that says \"You are not my friend.\" and decline them of any answers. I would be strict to them by avoiding and ignoring them when they do work. I would say cheating is bad and you should feel bad. They would literally become my enemies but that's OK.\r\n\r\n_+Because I rule them.+_\r\n\r\nDespite my none-cheating lifestyle, I got the best grades in school by a mile, easily beating all the cheaters and liars. I got so good that people started to stop cheating and study honestly. Even though they had bad grades at first, I helped them and ignored any cheaters. They became better and got average grades which is good enough for them to succeed. I felt happy and proud for them.\r\n\r\nThough, I guess I should also thank the cheaters despite me hating them. If it weren't for them, I wouldn't have been so motivated, got awesome grades and _crush them like the cheaters they are._\r\n\r\n[spoiler]This is just me missing high school. :D[/spoiler]","author":"4fe1b9f47f123b13df002976"},{"id":"54bb5b9b636872396c660700","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54bb5a986368724c578a0800#post_54bb5a986368724c578a0800\r\n\"@Number1pegasus\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54bb5b01636872781c1f0100#post_54bb5b01636872781c1f0100\r\nBecause this is teh first time that happens?\r\nAlso since when this thread becomes the Anime thread?\r\n\r\n\r\n","author":"5239db6da4c72d22d9000358"},{"id":"54bb5bc763687254b0370800","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Shadow the Hedgehog\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54bb5b9b636872396c660700#post_54bb5b9b636872396c660700\r\nIt's the time wasting thread.
