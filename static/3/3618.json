Even if you're 3/4 japanese it doesn't matter you're still considered a foreigner and people want you deported.  Even though the japanese culture of racism is polite and nobody is burning crosses on your yard it's still massively racist.\r\n5)While I do agree with his point that modern anime massively relies on tropes and cliches you can't blame everything on a generation as your defacto punching bag; the whole \"otakus are ruining japan\" shit is nothing more than the equivalent of the people who legitimately go \"thanks obama\" whenever they believe that obama is why the tooth fairy didn't give them a quarter.\r\n\r\nThe blaming otakus is one of the stupidest fucking things imaginable because it's \"oh no our birth rates now that we're a developed country have followed other developed countries by fitting perfectly into the trend of lower birth rates that economic forecasters predicted perfectly; well I'm going to ignore all of economic forecasters and all of science to blame otakus\"; \"oh no it's raining out and I don't have a umbrella; blame otakus\";  \"oh no our country is going to deflation and economic stagnation because we refuse to increase immigration to offset population decline due to economic development; blame otakus\".\r\n\r\nThe people that go \"it's otakus fault for Japan sinking economically\" are one of the dumbest fuckers on the planet cause they ignore all of economic science, business science, political science and all that crap just to perpetuate their belief while ignoring any evidence that contradicts them.\r\n\r\nThe \"otakus are ruining japan\" are nothing more than a bunch of stupid fuckers that ignore any and all of economic science to perpetuate their false belief.  Tumblr should actually read up on foreign nations instead of spouting meme crap believing it automatically.\r\n\r\nIf anything I respect the otakus people like to shit all over so much for being a generation that rejects the racism of their parents.\r\n\r\nThe comment by shenpai summarized in a nutshell, \"Feels before reals!\"\r\n!http://cdn.postgradproblems.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/d1f1b50cb668438a1dead9c5ddaeaa8e.gif!","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54c702b36368725cbdf10300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@QuasarNova\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54c7025f636872324dae0500#post_54c7025f636872324dae0500\r\ni ain't fucking for other's entertainment\r\ni fuck to pleasure my man","author":"4fe3df367f123b517900066a"},{"id":"54c703136368725cbdfb0300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54c702a16368726d43730200#post_54c702a16368726d43730200\r\n\r\n\"@mariomarc\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54c702b36368725cbdf10300#post_54c702b36368725cbdf10300\r\n*Wince*","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"54c70382636872678b771100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"!http://leoshop.com.tw/image/toy/kotobukiya/srg/101733htm.jpg!\r\nAw yeah!
