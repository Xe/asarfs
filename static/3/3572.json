Even though the game music MIDI it blows even AAA mainstream music out of the fucking water with a depthcharge.  One of the hardest questions you can ask any touhou fan is to name their top favorite songs; it's just impossible cause the music will rock your face clean off.  To put it in perspective every year gaku and all the touhoutards update a list of best music in the touhou fandom and uploads them to torrents and such all organized and rated; the folder for things rate 9.5 out of 10 or above when I tried to download it was like 1.2 terabytes and the entire torrent was like 140 terabytes.  To put that in perspective that's *23 YEARS* worth of music.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54c47c7a6368727f32430400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@ToskiHero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54c47bca6368724e8bee1900#post_54c47bca6368724e8bee1900\r\n...
