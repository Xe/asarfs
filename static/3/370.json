I would recommend starting with a .22 pistol, they are very easy to fire and won't intimidate you. After that, work your way up to a 9mm then to a .357. After that you will be well versed enough for a .45. If you really feel bold try a 500 S&W, but I warn you that you could hurt or even break your wrist if you are not careful.","author":"5010fa077f123b1e4f00104e"},{"id":"5386a75c636872175f8b0200","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Gizoid101\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5386a26d63687219666a0000#post_5386a26d63687219666a0000\r\n\r\nThis is the only weapon I need\r\n\r\n!http://a.tgcdn.net/images/products/zoom/943c_nerf_maverick.jpg!","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"}]}
