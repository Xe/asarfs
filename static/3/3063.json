In order for kingdom hearts to be revealed the *100%* completed keyblade has to be made, but this requires a extremely specific type of keyblade wielder and there has to be at least 13 dark keyblade wielders and 7 light keyblade wielders in order for the *100%* completed keyblade to be formed; this is why Ventus couldn't make the keyblade cause the requirements for the situation for the final keyblade to be made were all jacked up making his version of the final keyblade jacked up and thus it failed.\r\n\r\nFast forward a couple years that's where Sora inherits Ventus' keyblade.  Sora was never supposed to have the keyblade; Ventus gave it to him.  Here's where things get confusing; Xehanort cheats because he can time travel.  He's been planning out his evil schemes beforehand, traveling to the future, seeing how they fail, traveling back to the past and intentionally failing to prevent a paradox and eventually after KH2 and birth by sleep the heroes fall right into his plan.  Basically the reason why Sora and the other heroes even succeeded in the first place was because Xehanort is smart enough to know not to create a time paradox.\r\n\r\nThe reason why I'm excited for KH3 is because how can you permanently defeat a enemy that can just time travel into the future to see how you defeat him and prepare for it decades in advance?\r\n\r\nTl:dr; Xehanort in a nutshell:\r\n!http://timbox129.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/snapshot-17.jpg!\r\n\r\nSide note: if you're wondering how nobodies and heartless fit into it both nobodies and heartless do have hearts; Xehanort told nobodies that they don't have hearts to try to brainwash them into seeking kingdom hearts by becoming dark keyblade wielders.[/bq]\r\n\r\nWell, Shit! \r\n\r\nI guess you could say you got that story.\r\n\r\n!http://aliceindreamland.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/axel4.jpg!\r\nMemorized!\r\n\r\nI knew about the time travel but god dayum Xehanort you bastard! \r\n\r\n\r\nI didn't know you liked Kingdom Hearts Uc!","author":"50c204917f123b31440000a5"},{"id":"54aacdb663687224c3b81100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54aacd436368727483340600#post_54aacd436368727483340600\r\nThat is an apt description.
