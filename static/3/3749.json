If anything pokes Europe's economy at this point they're all getting sent back to the stone age; which is probably going to happen sooner rather than later cause the USA is recovering but we're also going into deflation meaning USA made products are going to start costing more meaning even more strain on the European economy.\r\n\r\nEuropean \"multiculturalism\" is fucking hilarious.  *EVERYBODY* knows how they have entire neighborhoods where people of certain races are \"happy\" to \"live with people of similar origins\".  I'll just straight up admit yes the USA still has Sundown Towns, *but* no one is \"happily suggesting that people stay together\" rather the primary reason why Sundown Towns still exist in the USA is because the families have been there for generations; if your parents, your grandparents, your great-grandparents, your great-great-grandparents and your great-great-great-granparents all were born and raised in the same area then chances are pretty high that the child will grow up and live in the same area.  The town I currently live in could be considered a Sundown Town cause Caucasians primarily live on the west side of the train tracks and minorities live on the east side, *BUT* it's because the families have been living in the same houses for centuries. The oldest house in the town was made in I believe in 1825 and the same family is still living there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I had to pick between shitty place to live A where it's ran by idiots who don't understand that if shit doesn't get done then the government can't function and shitty place to live B where the government is constantly breathing down your neck going \"Are you being not racist enough today?  Are you being not sexist enough today?  You didn't fulfil your quota of not racist enough today by 37%; why don't you try being not racist more by 37% today to fulfil your quota so you're not behind on your not racist quota\" I would have to pick shitty place to live A, cause sure they got healthcare and such but I wouldn't want the government constantly breathing down my neck worried about whether or not I'm not being politically correct.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you're wondering how I learned about European Sundown Towns it was from a British guy I knew that thought that it was \"so progressive of american government to help preserve african american culture by promoting neighborhoods in which they can preserve their heritage\"; everyone just looked at the guy like \"what the fuck are you talking about?!  We just live in these neighborhoods cause that's where our families are\"","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54cfbbbc636872168b430600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Too_Offensive\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54cfbaf66368726b7bca0f00#post_54cfbaf66368726b7bca0f00\r\nSame here.
