It cuts deep, it bleeds us and progress does not proceed in nice symmetrical lines for all aspects of society, worse still no one ever 100% agrees on what form of progress is desirable.\r\n\r\nAdd to it the fact that its all an utter crap shoot. The hope of the future, the thing we desperately need to be a bright shining beacon leading us to a better tomorrow could turn out to just be a the lure of an as yet unknown horror which ushers in death and destruction on scales we can scarcely imagine.\r\n\r\nThink of all the things people invented that they'd hoped would stop war by bringing humanity closer together, all of which went onto become tools of war in their own right, one of them, the airplane even delivering the only two wartime uses of the most horrific strain of weapon we've ever conceived, bombs that annihilated hundreds of thousands and etched their very shadows onto the ground.\r\n\r\nAnd yet we have to keep going because stagnation is worse. Trust once more in the unknown, or stay put and allow millions to starve, allow others to be beaten down, allow the world to grind us all into pulp.\r\n\r\n\"@someguy111\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/538a95c86368724eeb430400#post_538a95c86368724eeb430400\r\nHumans are much sturdier than you think. We're like rats in all the best possible ways, we go everywhere, fuck constantly and we can survive on more or less anything.
