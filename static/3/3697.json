In all YouTube vids, they appear to be really weak. True that they are weakers than regular crossbows. But, if they were used in war, they should be able to kill or wound a human right? It is said that they dipped the darts in poison to increase the chance of kill. But the weapon doesn't look like it has much stopping power. Its main power is its ability to rapid fire, and maybe scare off attackers.","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"54cc75af6368727a06d01b00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@trashboat\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54cc6bbb63687270834e0000#post_54cc6bbb63687270834e0000\r\n[bq=\"trashboat\"]!http://img15.hostingpics.net/pics/154958Cureblack.gif![/bq]\r\nJESUS","author":"50c204917f123b31440000a5"},{"id":"54cc7e9d6368724c0ce01400","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Hey guys, do you know any fanfics where one of the Mane Six disappears and a few years later, reappears but acts a lot different?\r\n\r\nI read one where Twilight disappears only to come back during her anniversary a few years later as battle-hardened space marine.\r\n\r\nThe idea is interesting itself.","author":"4fe1b9f47f123b13df002976"},{"id":"54cc83826368726f83b20e00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"Sword fighting 101: Common beginner mistakes and some basics\":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPJ6Lm2lYOw\r\n\r\nSkallagrim is awesome.","author":"4fde5cee945b700a970060fc"},{"id":"54cc88b26368727470fa0300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Goddammit.
