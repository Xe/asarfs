Getting a bit philosophical here but in the end almost every ideal is transient; what I mean by this is that for the past hundred years economics has operated under the principle that nothing will ever happen to change the variables when it comes to economies.  What do I mean by this?  Easy: \"What do you think would happen if OPEC were to not reduce production?\" \"It will never happen\" \"If it would happen what would you think would happen?\"  \"It doesn't matter cause it will never happen\".  Or in the current context \"What do you think would happen if the USA started experiencing deflation in spite of governmental spending\"  \"It will never happen\" \"Okay; well hypothetically if it were to happen what do you think the fallout of it would be\" \"There's no point in arguing cause the probability of it happening are small and therefore it will never happen\".\r\n\r\nTo put it simply people tend to think that cause something has say a 60% chance of happening that therefore it has a 100% chance of happening; on the flip side people tend to think that cause something has say a 1% chance of happening that therefore it has a 0% chance of happening.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhich brings us back to gas prices, deflation and the upcoming deflation crisis.\r\n\r\nWhat do I mean by this?  Easy; the usa is not governmentally prepared for deflation.  The usa plan of how to tackle the deficit was to continue to continue inflation until the real cost of the deficit could be easily paid off; that's why both parties have constantly refused to have a balanced budget because no inflation equals the real world cost of that deficit not decreasing.\r\n\r\nI have to disagree with a lot of people on the deflation being temporary; personally I think it'll be extremely long term because the price of oil is going down, there's multiple new technologies coming out soon that will decrease our consumption of oil thus leading to more deflation, there's multiple new technologies coming out soon that will decrease cost of manufacturing and so forth.\r\n\r\n\r\nTl:dr; personally I think the deflation is going to be long term deflation and that it's not going away any time soon at all.\r\n\r\n*Short version:\r\nUSA government, \"FUCK!  We're going to have to pay back our deficit in full\"\r\nConsumers, \"WOOHOO!\"*","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54c19cd76368725d30c31a00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Princess♠Molestia\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54c19c7c6368723e90dd0600#post_54c19c7c6368723e90dd0600\r\nTell that to anime.","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"54c19ce263687218eeb51f00","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Ore-O\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54c19c466368720c097f1400#post_54c19c466368720c097f1400\r\n!http://global3.memecdn.com/perfect-cell_o_667786.jpg!","author":"500757fd7f123b75a90003b1"},{"id":"54c19cf06368727222a61900","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Princess♠Molestia\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54c19c7c6368723e90dd0600#post_54c19c7c6368723e90dd0600\r\nThere's actually an explanation for that.
