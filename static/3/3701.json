Short version is that my cat, named Zack (yes I did name my cat after a FF character), got bit by a dog.  I'm listing all these things we can do for the cat to help him and she won't fucking listen to me.  Why?  Cause even though I'm 25 and have only lived in the same house for one year out of the past 6 she's still stuck in mommy mode and shit of \"oh I'm the mommy I know better\".  I know Zack is a cat, but I do have basic EMT training of \"that shit looks fucking infected\" and she's still stuck in \"I'm the mommy of my baby therefore I know better\".  It's a fucking infection on a cat that needs stitches; one of these days one of her cats is going to outright die cause she refuses to listen to me.\r\n\r\nSide note: he's somewhat alright; tonight I'm getting liquid stitches and some saline and some other stuff to help him.  I obviously am not a vet, but basic stuff like this I do know.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54cd68026368723e95680100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54cd67766368727cf1410200#post_54cd67766368727cf1410200\r\nYikes.","author":"505696b47f123b37e800effa"},{"id":"54cd681263687201892d0000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54cd67766368727cf1410200#post_54cd67766368727cf1410200\r\nMy best advice is just to grin and bare it.
