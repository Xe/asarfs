Basically what he proposed was that internet culture and geek culture are outright taking control of mainstream culture.  What he did was that he looked up online and compared real world celebrities vs online celebrities followers; short version is that online celebrities have far more followers on average on youtube, facebook and such.\r\n\r\nWhile you can say \"oh that's cause they're internet celebrities\" the thing to keep in mind is that \"video killed the radio star\" in that when television came out rather than overnight causing radio to no longer be king it was a gradual over time change.  The reason why this is relevant is that over the past four years there has been a significant reduction of people who buy cable and are just switching to netflix or such.\r\n\r\nThe reason why this is relevant is that the reduction in number of cable users is that of rising cost of paid television vs internet; at this rate the rate at which people are cutting the cord will start to drastically increase over time as the internet becomes cheaper and cheaper and faster and faster.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo summarize it: basically cable television is losing popularity because of costs whereas the internet is gaining popularity due to ever faster internet speeds thus this is compounding how popular internet stars are because traditional stars for the most part aren't tech savvy.","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54d655bc6368725b21480100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Jesus.\r\nI just got thrashed!","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54d656006368722488630500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54d655bc6368725b21480100#post_54d655bc6368725b21480100\r\nFriends FAUGHT FOR!\r\n\r\nAlso I wont lie I was playing some online matches earlier ago.
