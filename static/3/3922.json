They literally make it terrible for everyone else and they go around schools, telling innocent kids how it's bad and you too should stop it. They will make protests, public hating and other crazy stuff. Even the government is involved! Hell, politicians use this to their advantage by making their image better through publicly protesting about this and \"teaching\" kids about the sins of this holiday.\r\n\r\nFuck it! I love my country and I myself am a patriot, but sometimes I just think that my own race or religion is controlled by a bunch of stereotypes, fascists, general haters and SJWs, and everyone is OK with that!\r\n\r\nThis is why I like the Chinese better. Heck, my best friend is one and he isn't a dick like the other people of my race and religion has to offer.","author":"4fe1b9f47f123b13df002976"},{"id":"54db19136368723467862500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@HJSDGCE\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54db17886368726508fa1900#post_54db17886368726508fa1900\r\nI did\r\nhttp://blogs.wsj.com/scene/2011/02/11/in-malaysia-watch-out-for-the-valentines-day-police/","author":"4fe16df67f123b13e400003f"},{"id":"54db19e8636872045f680600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@HJSDGCE\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54db17886368726508fa1900#post_54db17886368726508fa1900\r\nLeast your country doesn't a civil war going on. \r\n\r\nEver heard of the Fallen 44?\r\n\r\nMilitary operations being run by politicians is a recipe for disaster and death.","author":"52f0834d63687261cba90300"},{"id":"54db4a3e6368726508502100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"It's quiet...\r\n\r\n_Too_ quiet.","author":"5463ecb86368727b8e910000"},{"id":"54db4a6863687201ebdb1700","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@DiamondsAreForOften\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54db4a3e6368726508502100#post_54db4a3e6368726508502100\r\n*Random loud noises*\r\nLifes still exist, friend.","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"54db4b326368727910591600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@Carcass Strife\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54db4a6863687201ebdb1700#post_54db4a6863687201ebdb1700\r\nThank goodness for that.
