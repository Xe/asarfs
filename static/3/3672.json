It can return things to their original state. So lets say you tear a piece of cloth from someone's clothes who is running away. You use Crazy Diamond and the piece of cloth starts flying in the direction of of it's source. Effectively becoming a tracking device. There was also this cool scene involving destroying and fixing a motorcycle in like two pages.
