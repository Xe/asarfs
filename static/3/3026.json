Yeah.\r\nAnyways my point is that shonen fans are drastically over estimating the potential of boku no hero academia and other shonen.  If you were right then in five years time every person on the planet will have all the volumes on shrines in their houses and sacrifice small animals to ephigies of the creator.  I'll totally admit it's popular, but it's not Naruto popular.\r\n\r\nI'm not going to lie; I totally hate shonen and hope that boku no hero academia doesn't reach Naruto levels popular.  Why do I hate shonen?  Cause shonen is the new \"cool\" thing.  You know how in middle school people would ostracize geeks?  Well now shonen has replaced the bullies; if you don't like shonen you get ostracized.  I'll totally admit that I'm biased and am glad that hentai and ecchi is making a popularity comeback not just cause I like hentai, but because back when naruto was popular I lost dozens of friends cause I hated naruto.  Shonen is like the manga equivalent of call of duty where if you don't like call of duty as a kid you get shunned super hard socially.\r\n\r\nI still stand by that everyone is massively over-estimating boku no hero academia and they are vastly over estimating shonen's popularity, but I'll totally admit that I'm biased against it cause fuck shonen cause it's the manga equivalent of call of duty where if a kid doesn't like it they get socially shunned and I remember getting shunned in high school cause I didn't like naruto or dbz or one piece or any of that.  I totally admit it's biased but I personally hate shonen cause it's fucking ridiculous that geeks that used to get bullied now bully anyone who has different tastes than them.  I'm going to be completely honest here; I highly doubt shonen is popular with kids because the majority of them enjoy it; rather I have a feeling that a lot of the kids feel as though they have to like it or they'll get shunned by their friends.\r\n\r\nTl:dr; fuck shonen","author":"38b55cdf63616403d7560600"},{"id":"54a8a9086368727fe9f50500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a8a8946368727efb010700#post_54a8a8946368727efb010700\r\n[bq=\"uc9\"]\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a8a41763687278d4b70400#post_54a8a41763687278d4b70400\r\n\r\nTl:dr; fuck -shonen- action adventure manga that appeals to the lowest common denominator but is far more marketable than other titles objectively speaking[/bq]\r\n\r\nFix'd","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"54a8a9216368727f251c0500","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@uc9\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a8a8946368727efb010700#post_54a8a8946368727efb010700\r\nIt CAN'T be that people like Hero Academia and World Trigger because they're good.\r\n_Nooooo that can't be it._","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54a8a93763687275d3500300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"Fell asleep like this\r\n!http://media.tumblr.com/f1952e7c7564fa414b0f6e45c3771d20/tumblr_inline_n6mbvfAH5y1s9979a.gif!","author":"5446fcfc6368723ec21a0000"},{"id":"54a8a9656368727eeccc0600","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@QuasarNova\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a8a9086368727fe9f50500#post_54a8a9086368727fe9f50500\r\nWhy is it so hard for him to understand that?","author":"4fde4618945b700aa0002fff"},{"id":"54a8a9ca636872795ffa0300","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54a8a9656368727eeccc0600#post_54a8a9656368727eeccc0600\r\n\r\nBecause he has an view of the world different than the rest of us dear.
