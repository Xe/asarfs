I bought it and it was a really depressing experience for me, if only because I could see a good game trying to get out but hampered by a lot of stupid bullshit (most notably, the fucking real money auction house and the resulting crappy loot system and always online requirement. If I'm playing a game single player I should not be dying because of lag.)\r\n\r\nSupposedly this patch is going to make Diablo III the game it was supposed to be. I'm going to give it another chance (I mean, I already blew the sixty bucks on it so why not?) and I'm curios if anyone else is.","author":"4f41ee04945b701c41002af7"},{"id":"5306366f63687261c5090000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"I was reading the news and came across this:\r\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/20/garden/small-world-big-idea.html?_r=0\r\n\r\nYou know, as someone that has been homeless before this is a really good idea; the reason being is that homeless shelters a lot of the money gets eaten up by construction, having 24/7 staff all the time and so forth.

Dunno, it just rubs me the wrong way. In this story, despite loving dressing like a guy, the protagonist changes her outfit to the more girly side because \"my best friend since I was a child says that I'm not a boy and he likes me like this\", I guess. \r\n\r\nWhat really confuses me is that shoujo romance usually tries to display the \"perfect\" romance for its female audience, so to see it advocated that you should change some harmless part of yourself for a guy just sucks. I get that Japan has different morals or whatever, but...ugh.\r\n\r\nWhat cracks me up is that the manga is called \"Even Today I Am Strong\". Like, what? How are you strong? I guess there was a bit where she confronted her daddy issues, kind of, but the entire story was centered around her dressing like a girl for the people around her, not herself (friends, her mother, her best friend), despite liking how she already dressed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"@gasmaskangel\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5306d1aa63687246c3ec0100#post_5306d1aa63687246c3ec0100\r\n\r\nHeh.","author":"5041b54f7f123b77af00a442"},{"id":"5306d74263687256cf620000","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@gasmaskangel\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5306d1aa63687246c3ec0100#post_5306d1aa63687246c3ec0100\r\nNow imagine how Obama fits into this.

Had the manga continued past one volume, I'd bet my house that the two would have stayed together past college, probably would have gotten married.\r\n\r\nCouples in shoujo might fight, but if the author's already confirmed that they're \"perfect\" for one another?

(I've only read some bits of Paradise Kiss and XXHolic, yet Hetalia isn't considered one... huh.)\r\n\r\nAnd I agree, Shojo tends to play it safe most of the time, but I laso liek the fact that most endings are ambiguous since for japanese, the ending is not important as much as how they develop and make their relationship grow. I think it has to do with how wrokaholics they are and marriage ends up being a compromise were you can't do anything else except working.","author":"4fdfbf92945b7075d50036e4"},{"id":"5306d9ff63687256962b0100","topic_id":"5161dd617f123bd25900013d","body":"\"@twistedmetalero\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/5305818e6368724413420000#post_5305818e6368724413420000\r\nGreentexting is so easy to get used to that I want to use it everywhere on the web.","author":"4fe16df67f123b13e400003f"}]}
