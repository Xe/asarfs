As you slowly and painfully lose consciousness, you notice your body being dragged away. When you wake up, you look yourself in the mirror and find yourself _changed_. There, a scientist reveals himself and state that he was trying to find the cure and needed your help. Normal zombies would still react towards you but unlike towards humans, they were slower and as long as you don't go too close, they won't notice. Specials would notice though.\r\n\r\nThen you can add mutation upgrades that gives you powers like Bioshock. Also, enemies with said powers.\r\n\r\nAnd then you learned that the scientist was the bad guy and he planted a microchip in your brain that would kill you. Then you got it out and helped the other survivors. Then you meet more like you by stealing the scientist's documents.\r\n\r\nThen some final boss mission where you hunt him and some other business dude who was wanting to sell the cure in high prices.\r\n\r\n\"@SquiggyBomb\":/dis/the-time-wasting-thread/post/54d230c0636872797fc60900#post_54d230c0636872797fc60900\r\nI read that manga!
